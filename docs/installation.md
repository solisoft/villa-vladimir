# Installation

## Prerequisites

None. Soli is a single binary with no Node.js, npm, OpenSSL or database to install first. The quick installer below only needs `curl`.

## Install SoliLang

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solisoft/soli_lang/main/install.sh | sh
```

This detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release binary, and installs it to `~/.local/bin`.

It says which versions it saw: the `soli` already in the install directory, the one it downloaded, and the one it installed, read from each binary with `soli --version`. When the shell would run a different `soli` first on your `PATH`, it names that copy and its version, since that is the one your commands will reach. If GitHub's API does not answer (it is rate-limited without a token), it downloads the latest release through GitHub's `latest/download` link instead, and the version still comes from the binary.

When run as **root** (e.g. through `sudo`, or inside a Docker image build), the installer
automatically targets `/usr/local/bin` so every user on the machine can run `soli` — no
`--system` flag needed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solisoft/soli_lang/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

A global install also removes any stale per-user copy (e.g. `/root/.local/bin/soli`) left by
older installs, so PATH can't shadow the new binary with an outdated one.

For system-wide installation as a non-root user (the script will use `sudo` for the copy step):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solisoft/soli_lang/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --system
```

To force a per-user install even when running as root, pass `--user`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solisoft/soli_lang/main/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- --user
```

### Updating

`soli update` replaces the binary in place, wherever it was installed. If Soli lives in a
root-owned directory (such as `/usr/local/bin`), run the update with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo soli update
```

Running `soli update` without the needed permissions prints a hint telling you to re-run with
`sudo`.

### Via Cargo

```bash
cargo install solilang
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/solisoft/soli_lang.git
cd soli_lang

# Build the project (full default features)
cargo build --release

# Install globally — always use --locked so Cargo.lock is honoured
cargo install --path . --locked
```

The default `release` profile builds on every core with ThinLTO. The published
binaries use the `dist` profile instead. It uses fat LTO and a single codegen
unit, so it runs a few percent faster but takes several minutes longer to build
on one core. Use it for a production or benchmark build:

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked --profile dist   # binary in target/dist/
cargo install solilang --locked --profile dist   # same, from crates.io
```

To shrink the binary (and baseline RSS) when you only need SoliDB, drop optional
subsystems at build time — see [Configuration → Slim binary](configuration.md#slim-binary-cargo-features):

```bash
# SoliDB-only: no Postgres/MySQL/SQLite clients, no PASETO
cargo install --path . --locked --no-default-features \
  --features embedding,llm,codegraph
```

## Docker

Soli ships an official container image on the GitHub Container Registry, rebuilt
and published for every release.

```bash
# Pull the latest release (or pin a version, e.g. :v1.13.5)
docker pull ghcr.io/solisoft/soli_lang:latest
```

The image's entrypoint **is** the `soli` binary, so any `soli` subcommand works
as the container command:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/solisoft/soli_lang:latest --version
```

### Run a Soli app in a container

Mount your project into the container and publish the server port. The server
binds `0.0.0.0` by default, so the published port is reachable from the host:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5011:5011 \
  -v "$(pwd):/app" -w /app \
  ghcr.io/solisoft/soli_lang:latest serve . --port 5011
```

Your app is now available at `http://localhost:5011`.

### Build the image yourself

The repository ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` that compiles a release binary
and copies it into a slim Debian runtime:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solisoft/soli_lang.git
cd soli_lang
docker build -t soli .
docker run --rm soli --version
```

## Create a New MVC Project

```bash
soli new my_app
cd my_app
soli serve . --dev
```

There is no `npm install` step and no `package.json`: `soli new` compiles
`app/assets/css/application.css` itself, with the same checksummed standalone
Tailwind binary the dev server uses, and commits the result. Node is not
required to build or run a Soli app.

## Project Setup

### 1. Configure Routes

Edit `config/routes.sl`:

```soli
get("/", "home#index");
get("/about", "home#about");
post("/contact", "home#contact");
```

### 2. Create Controllers

Create controllers in `app/controllers/`:

```soli
def index
  return render("home/index", {
    "title": "Welcome"
  })
end
```

### 3. Add Views

Create templates in `app/views/home/`:

```erb
<h1><%= title %></h1>
<p>Welcome to my app!</p>
```

## Running in Development

```bash
soli serve . --dev
```

In `--dev` mode the server compiles your Tailwind CSS for you: it scans
`app/assets/css/*.css`, detects whether the project is **Tailwind v3 or v4**
(from your CSS directives, and from `package.json` if you keep one), and
writes the result to `public/css/`. It recompiles on startup and whenever
views, asset CSS, controllers, or helpers change, so new utility classes show
up on the next reload.

Which Tailwind binary it uses:

- a local `node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss` if present — `soli new` does not
  create one, but a project that keeps its own npm toolchain has deliberately
  installed that CLI, so its version wins; otherwise
- a SHA-256-pinned standalone CLI downloaded to `~/.soli/bin/` (v4.3.1 for
  v4 projects, v3.4.17 for legacy v3 projects).

### Pinning a Tailwind version

To compile with a version other than the built-in pin, name it in `soli.toml`:

```toml
[assets]
tailwind_version = "4.1.5"
# Optional: pin the exact bytes. Without it, the download is verified against
# the release's own sha256sums.txt, which proves you received what the release
# lists — not that the release is what someone vetted.
tailwind_sha256 = "…64 hex characters…"
```

`SOLI_TAILWIND_VERSION` and `SOLI_TAILWIND_SHA256` override the file, so CI and
one-off upgrade checks need no commit. A project-chosen version is cached under
its own name, so two projects on different Tailwinds do not fight over one file.
If no checksum can be obtained, nothing is installed — an unverified binary is
never executed.

Because the dev server handles this, a separate Tailwind watcher is optional. If
you prefer the official `--watch` incremental mode, install the CLI yourself at
`node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss` and run it alongside `soli serve`.

## Building for Production

```bash
# CSS is compiled by `soli serve . --dev`; commit public/css/ so the
# deployed app ships it. To rebuild explicitly, touch a file under
# app/assets/css/ and start the dev server once.

# Build the shipped (fat-LTO) binary: target/dist/soli
cargo build --profile dist --locked
```

## Verifying Installation

Create a test file:

```soli
# test.sl
println("Hello, SoliLang!");
```

Run it:

```bash
soli test.sl
```

You should see: `Hello, SoliLang!`

## Serving a Folder

`soli serve` does not need a project. Point it at any directory and it serves that directory as a
website — files off disk, `.md` rendered as pages, and a generated index for every folder:

```bash
soli serve ./notes --dev
```
