# Models

Models manage data and business logic in your MVC application. SoliLang provides a simple OOP-style interface for database operations.

To bind a model to a named database (SoliDB, Postgres, MySQL, or SQLite), use class-body `connection "name"` with `config/database.toml` — see **[Multiple Databases](multi-database.md)**.

## Which backends support what

This page documents the full surface, which is what **SoliDB** (the default)
provides. The SQL adapters — `postgres`, `mysql`, `sqlite` — run the portable
part of it; anything they do not implement raises an error naming the feature
rather than returning wrong rows.

| Area | SoliDB | Postgres / MySQL / SQLite |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| `Model.find_by_sql(sql, binds?)` | ✗ (use `Model.query` with SDBQL) | ✓ |
| CRUD, validations, callbacks, scopes, soft delete | ✓ | ✓ |
| Hash `.where`, order/limit/offset, count, exists | ✓ | ✓ |
| Aggregations (`sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`/`count`), multi-row `group_by` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `pluck` / `select`, `delete_all` / `update_all`, batch ops | ✓ | ✓ |
| `.includes` for `belongs_to` / `has_many` / `has_one` / HABTM | ✓ | ✓ (batched) |
| `Transactions` (`Model.transaction`) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Raw SDBQL string `.where("doc…")` | ✓ | ✗ (use `Model.find_by_sql`) |
| A raw string `.where` chained onto a hash `.where` | ✓ | ✗ — refused, not silently dropped |
| `.join` (relation existence filter), `.having` | ✓ | ✓ on document tables |
| `.includes` with `through:` | ✓ (accessor only) | ✓ on document tables (three batched queries) |
| Graph/edge models, vector search, timeseries, columnar, `grouped {}` | ✓ | ✗ |
| Encrypted attributes (`encrypts`), STI, counter caches | ✓ | ✓ (column mode: `encrypts` on text columns; STI needs a string `type` column) |

On a SQL adapter, mixing the two `.where` forms is an error rather than a
partial query:

```soli
# Refused on SQL — the raw predicate is SoliDB syntax and cannot be compiled.
User.where({ "active": true }).where("doc.age >= @min", { "min": 18 })

# Express both conditions in the hash form instead.
User.where({ "active": true, "age": { "gte": 18 } })
```

The raw filter used to be discarded silently, so that first query returned
minors. It now raises with the hash equivalent named in the message.

### Merge-patch semantics

`update(hash)` / `save(hash)` / `.update_all(hash)` **merge** rather than
replace, following [RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396) on every
adapter:

- a key with an object value **merges recursively**, keeping the stored
  object's other keys
- a key with a `null` value **removes** the key
- anything else replaces the key
- arrays replace wholesale — they are never merged element-wise

```soli
# stored: { "prefs": { "theme": "dark", "lang": "fr" }, "note": "hi" }
record.update({ "prefs": { "theme": "light" }, "note": null })
# result: { "prefs": { "theme": "light", "lang": "fr" } }
```

Earlier cuts diverged here: Postgres used a shallow merge that stored a null,
while SQLite and MySQL applied RFC 7396 — so the same call destroyed unrelated
nested keys on one adapter and not the others. Removing a key rather than storing
a null makes no difference to `record.field` (both read as `nil`) or to the
soft-delete scope (both satisfy `IS NULL`).

On Postgres, a patch containing a nested object needs a read-modify-write under
a row lock rather than a single statement. Inside a `Model.transaction` that
nests with a `SAVEPOINT`, so it is atomic on its own and still rolls back with
the enclosing block; outside one it runs in a transaction of its own. Either
way two concurrent merges of the same row serialize instead of clobbering each
other.

A model that declares `table "orders"` runs in **column mode** against a real
relational schema — one you already have, or one a
[migration](migrations.md#on-the-sql-adapters) creates with a column hash. Its
narrower support line is documented under
[Column-aware models](multi-database.md#column-aware-models-existing-databases).

## Defining Models

Create model files in `app/models/`. The collection name is **automatically derived** from the class name:

- `User` → `"users"`
- `BlogPost` → `"blog_posts"`
- `UserProfile` → `"user_profiles"`

**Automatic Collection Creation**: When you call a Model method (like `create()`, `all()`, `find()`, etc.) on a collection that doesn't exist yet, SoliLang will automatically create the collection for you. If the configured **database** doesn't exist yet either, it is created on that same first call before the collection. This means you can start using your models immediately without running migrations first.

- `User` → `"users"`
- `BlogPost` → `"blog_posts"`
- `UserProfile` → `"user_profiles"`

```soli
# app/models/user.sl
class User < Model
end
```

```soli
# app/models/blog_post.sl
class BlogPost < Model
end
```

That's it! No need to manually specify collection names or field definitions.

## Auto-Loading

Every `.sl` file under `app/models/` is loaded automatically at startup — by `soli serve` (in each worker), the REPL, `soli db:migrate`, and `soli db:seed`. Model classes are therefore available everywhere (controllers, views, other models, migrations, seeds, the REPL) without an `import` statement.

```soli
# app/controllers/users_controller.sl — no import needed
class UsersController < Controller
  def index
    @users = User.all
  end
end
```

Loading is **recursive** — subdirectories are walked too, so `app/models/billing/invoice.sl` is auto-loaded just like a top-level file. The same recursive auto-loader also covers two sibling directories, loaded before controllers so they can be referenced freely:

- **`app/services/`** — integration / domain-service classes (Stripe, mailers, etc.)
- **`app/policies/`** — authorization policies (see [Authorization](authorization.md))

Within a directory, files load in alphabetical order and *before* their subdirectories (top-down). Soli executes files eagerly, so if one class extends another defined in a different file, keep the base class at an equal-or-shallower depth (e.g. `app/models/application_record.sl`) so it loads first.

In `--dev`, edits to nested files under these directories hot-reload without a restart.

If you run a model, service, or controller file directly with `soli path/to/file.sl`, the auto-loader does **not** run — in that case you still need explicit imports.

## CRUD Operations

> **Auto-creation**: All Model operations automatically create the collection — and the database itself, if it's missing too — when it doesn't exist. This only happens on the first call that encounters a missing collection or database.

### Creating Records

```soli
result = User.create({
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30
});
# Returns: { "valid": true, "record": { "id": "...", "email": "...", ... } }
# Or on validation failure: { "valid": false, "errors": [...] }
```

### Finding Records

```soli
# Find by ID
user = User.find("user123");

# Find all
users = User.all;

# Find with where clause — Hash form (recommended for user input)
# Each key is validated as an identifier and values flow through
# bind parameters, so attacker-controlled values can never reach the
# query template. Top-level keys join with AND.
admins = User.where({ "role": "admin", "active": true }).all;
alice  = User.where({ "email": "alice@example.com" }).first;

# Comparisons, IN, LIKE, and OR are portable — they compile on SoliDB
# and on every SQL adapter (document tables and column-aware models):
adults = User.where({ "age": { "gte": 18 } }).all;
open   = Order.where({
  "status": ["open", "draft"],
  "total": { "gt": 100 },
  "email": { "ilike": "%@example.com" },
  "or": [{ "state": "draft" }, { "state": "open" }]
}).all;

# Find with where clause — string form (developer-trusted only)
# Use this when you need an expression the hash vocabulary cannot
# express. The string MUST NOT come from untrusted input.
results = User.where("doc.age >= @min_age AND doc.role == @role", {
  "min_age": 21,
  "role": "admin"
}).all;
```

| Hash value | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| scalar (`"open"`, `18`, `true`, `null`) | equality (`==`) |
| `{ "gt" }` / `{ "gte" }` / `{ "lt" }` / `{ "lte" }` | comparison (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`); `eq` / `ne` also accepted |
| `{ ">": 100 }`, `{ "!=": "open" }`, … | the symbols are accepted spellings of the same operators |
| `[1, 2, 3]` or `{ "in": [1, 2, 3] }` | `IN` (an empty list matches nothing) |
| `{ "like": "INV%" }` / `{ "ilike": "%@x.com" }` | SQL `LIKE` / case-insensitive `LIKE` (`%` any run, `_` one character) |
| `"or": [ {…}, {…} ]` / `"and": [ {…}, {…} ]` | boolean grouping |

#### Operator reference

All of this is verified behaviour, not intent — the surprises are per-backend and
worth knowing before you rely on one.

**The three value forms.** A scalar means equality, an array means `IN`, and a
hash means comparisons. Several operators on one field are ANDed, and several
fields are ANDed:

```soli
Order.where({
  "status": "open",                       # equality
  "total":  { "gte": 100, "lt": 500 },    # both, ANDed
  "region": ["eu", "us"],                 # IN
  "or": [{ "rush": true }, { "vip": true } ]
})
```

`or` and `and` take an **array of hashes** (an empty array is an error) and may
nest. Any hash inside them is a full filter again.

**Ordering comparisons follow the value's type.** A number compares numerically;
a **string compares as text**, which is what makes ISO-8601 dates and timestamps
work — they sort correctly as strings:

```soli
Invoice.where({ "issued_at": { "gte": "2026-01-01", "lt": "2026-07-01" } })
```

**`null` and missing keys.** `{ "field": null }` is `IS NULL` and
`{ "field": { "ne": null } }` is `IS NOT NULL`; any other operator against `null`
is an error rather than a clause that silently never matches. A document that
never had the key reads as `NULL`, so `{ "nope": null }` matches **every** row.

**`IN` details.** An empty list matches nothing (it compiles to a false
predicate, not a syntax error). A `null` inside the list adds `IS NULL`, because
SQL `IN` never matches `NULL`. Each element keeps the type semantics equality
would give it, so a list may mix strings and numbers.

**`like` / `ilike`** need a string pattern (`%` = any run, `_` = one character).
Case sensitivity is where the backends genuinely differ:

| | `like` | `ilike` |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres | case-**sensitive** | `ILIKE` |
| SQLite | case-**insensitive** for ASCII (its `LIKE` is) | `LOWER(x) LIKE LOWER(?)` |
| MySQL | depends on the column/collation | `LOWER(x) LIKE LOWER(?)` |
| SoliDB | SDBQL `LIKE` | also `LIKE` — no separate case-folding |

If case behaviour matters, use `ilike` and get the same answer everywhere.

**Numbers compare differently per backend on document tables.** Postgres compares
`jsonb` numerically, so `{ "v": 10 }` matches a stored `10.0`; MySQL and SQLite
compare the JSON representation, where it does not. Store numbers consistently if
you filter on them.

**Index interaction.** String equality and string `IN` compile to the JSON *text*
extract — the expression an `index` declaration creates — so they can use it.
Numeric comparisons use a numeric cast, which an expression index on the text
form does not cover. See [`index` on the SQL adapters](#index-on-the-sql-adapters).

**On column-aware models** (`table "orders"`) the same hash compiles against the
real columns with typed binds, so each comparison is the column's own type and
ordering on a text column follows the database's collation. A field that is not a
column is refused by name, listing the columns that exist.

**Operator spellings.** Each comparison also answers to its symbol, so
`{ "total": { ">": 100 } }` and `{ "total": { "gt": 100 } }` compile to the same
predicate: `>` `>=` `<` `<=` for the four comparisons, `==` or `=` for `eq`, and
`!=` or `<>` for `ne`. `or` / `and` are matched case-insensitively.

**Errors name the vocabulary.** An unknown operator reports
`gt, gte, lt, lte, eq, ne, like, ilike, in` and the symbols; a field name that is
not an identifier is refused before anything is compiled.

> **Security — `where(...)` filter forms.** The Hash form
> (`where({field: value, ...})`) is safe for user input: keys are
> validated as `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` identifiers of at most 128
> characters (the same cap applies to `order` and `find_by` field names, on
> every adapter), operators are a
> fixed vocabulary, and values are bound, so nothing from `req["params"]`
> can become AQL or SQL syntax. The string form
> (`where("doc.foo == @foo", {...})`) splices the filter argument
> verbatim into the query — treat it as developer-trusted only, like a
> `format!()` template. Building a filter string from request data
> **will leak injection**. Prefer the hash form whenever it can express
> the predicate, including on the SQL adapters.

### Updating Records

```soli
# Static method: update by ID
User.update("user123", {
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "age": 31
});

# Instance method: modify fields and save
user = User.find("user123");
user.name = "Alice Smith";
user.age = 31;
user.save();

# Instance method with bulk-update hash (same merge-then-persist path,
# one call instead of N assignments + save)
user = User.find("user123");
user.save({ "name": "Alice Smith", "age": 31 });

# `.update(hash)` is equivalent on an existing record
user.update({ "name": "Alice Smith", "age": 31 });
```

`instance.to_h()` returns the record's user fields as a Hash, dropping the
`_`-prefixed framework fields (`_key`, `_id`, `_rev`, `_errors`, …). Handy for
serialization, diffing, and content hashing:

```soli
user = User.find("user123");
user.to_h();   # { "name": "Alice Smith", "age": 31 }
```

### Deleting Records

```soli
User.delete("user123");
```

### Counting Records

```soli
total = User.count;
```

## Query Builder Chaining

Chain methods to build complex queries:

```soli
results = User
  .where("doc.age >= @age", { "age": 18 })
  .where("doc.active == @active", { "active": true })
  .order("created_at", "desc")
  .limit(10)
  .offset(20)
  .all;

# Get first result only
first = User.where("doc.email == @email", { "email": "alice@example.com" }).first;

# Count with conditions
count = User.where("doc.role == @role", { "role": "admin" }).count;
```

## Static Methods Reference

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Model.create(data)` | Insert a new document |
| `Model.create_many([data, ...])` | Batch insert multiple documents in one round trip (one SQL statement per chunk, or one SoliDB `BulkInsert` / one `INSERT` query), returns `{ created, errors }`. An open transaction inserts one row at a time so each row joins the transaction. On SoliDB the batch succeeds or reports one error in `errors`; rows before the failing one may already be stored, so wrap it in `transaction` when you need all-or-nothing. |
| `Model.find(id)` | Get document by ID. **Raises** `RecordNotFound` if missing (auto-mapped to a 404 HTTP response). Use `find_by` for optional lookups. A key that is empty, `.` or `..` is refused (`invalid document key`) here and in `update`/`delete` — as are such collection names in the raw SoliDB client (`invalid path segment`) — so a request-supplied id can never address a different path. |
| `Model.find_by(field, value)` | Find first record by field value. Returns `null` when missing. |
| `Model.first_by(field, value)` | Find first record by field with ordering |
| `Model.find_or_create_by(field, value, data?)` | Find by field, or create if not found |
| `Model.where(hash)` | Hash filter — safe for user input (keys validated, values bound). Returns QueryBuilder |
| `Model.where(string, bind_vars)` | SDBQL filter string — **developer-trusted only**, never feed `req[...]` into the string. Returns QueryBuilder |
| `Model.all` | Get all documents |
| `Model.find_each(block, opts?)` | Walk every document one at a time in keyset-paged batches, holding one batch in memory. See [Batch Iteration](#batch-iteration-find_each--in_batches). |
| `Model.in_batches(block, opts?)` | Same paging, but the block receives each batch as an array. Alias: `find_in_batches`. |
| `Model.update(id, data)` | Update a document |
| `Model.upsert(id, data)` | Insert or update document by ID |
| `Model.delete(id)` | Delete a document |
| `Model.delete_all` | Wipe every document in the collection (primarily for test setup/teardown). Use `Model.where(...).delete_all` for filtered bulk deletes. |
| `Model.count` | Count all documents |
| `Model.reset_counters(id, relation)` | Recount a `has_many` relation's children (minus soft-deleted) and write the [counter cache](#counter-caches) column; returns the fresh count |
| `Model.transaction do … end` | Run a block in a transaction — commit on success, roll back on throw |
| `Model.transaction("aql")` | Execute a single AQL statement transactionally |
| `Model.transaction()` | Get transaction handle for manual control |
| `Model.<scope_name>` | Invoke a named scope declared with `scope(name, fn)` (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.with_deleted()` | Include soft-deleted records (QueryBuilder) |

| `Model.select(field, ...)` | Select specific fields (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.fields(field, ...)` | Alias for `select()` (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.join(rel, filter?, binds?)` | Filter by related existence (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.order(field, dir?)` | Order results (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.limit(n)` | Limit results (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.offset(n)` | Offset results (returns QueryBuilder) |
| `Model.timeout(secs)` | Raise this query's request timeout (returns QueryBuilder). See [Query timeouts](#query-timeouts). |
| `Model.paginate(hash)` | Terminal: fetch paginated results + metadata. See [Pagination](#pagination) below. |
| `Model.time_bucket(interval, aggs?)` | Timeseries models only: bucketed aggregation (returns QueryBuilder, chain `.all`). See [Timeseries Models](#timeseries-models). |
| `Model.prune(cutoff?)` | Timeseries models only: delete rows older than a duration (`"30d"`) or RFC3339 cutoff; without an argument uses the declared `retention:`. Returns the number deleted. |
| `Model.group_by(fields)` | Grouped aggregation — field name or array; without `aggregate` yields a count per group (`n`). Returns QueryBuilder, chain `.all`. See [Analytics](analytics.md#rich-aggregation-document-models). |
| `Model.aggregate(spec)` | Multi-aggregate spec `{ alias: [func, field] }` (or `["count"]`); with `group_by` one row per group, without it one row (chain `.first`). See [Analytics](analytics.md#rich-aggregation-document-models). |
| `Model.median(field) / stddev / variance / count_distinct` | Statistical aggregation terminals (returns QueryBuilder, chain `.first`) |
| `Model.similar(query, field?, k?, opts?)` | Vector similarity search; with a declared `vector_index` pushes down to the HNSW ANN index. `opts`: `{ "exact": true }`. See [Search](search.md#vector-search-similar). |
| `Model.search(query, opts?)` | Fulltext search (requires `fulltext_index`); eager, ranked, results carry `_search_score`. See [Search](search.md#fulltext-search-search). |
| `Model.near(lat, lon, opts?)` | Geo search sorted by distance (requires `geo_index`); results carry `_distance` in meters. See [Search](search.md#geo-search-near--within). |
| `Model.within(lat, lon, radius)` | Geo search inside a radius in meters (requires `geo_index`). See [Search](search.md#geo-search-near--within). |
| `Model.insert_rows(rows)` | Columnar models only: batch append, returns `{ "inserted": n, "ids": [...] }`. See [Analytics](analytics.md#columnar-models). |
| `Model.aggregate(field, op, opts?)` | Columnar models only: scalar aggregate, or per-group rows with `{ "group_by": [...] }` |
| `Model.query(spec)` | Columnar models only: fetch rows (`columns` / one `filter` / `limit`) |
| `Model.add_column_index(field, kind?)` / `column_indexes` / `drop_column_index(field)` | Columnar models only: manage column indexes (`sorted` default, `hash`, `bitmap`, `minmax`, `bloom`) |
| `Model.columnar_stats` | Columnar models only: store-level statistics |

## Relationship DSL

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `has_many(name)` | Declare a one-to-many relationship |
| `has_one(name)` | Declare a one-to-one relationship |
| `belongs_to(name)` | Declare an inverse relationship |
| `edge from:, to:` | Declare an edge model over a SolidB edge collection. See [Graph Models](#graph-models-edges-and-traversal). |

Options accepted by `has_many`/`has_one`/`belongs_to` (a bad option raises at
class load with an actionable message):

| Option | On | Description |
|--------|----|-------------|
| `class_name:` | all | Override the related class (`has_many "posts", class_name: "Article"`) |
| `foreign_key:` | all | Override the FK field name |
| `dependent:` | has_many, has_one | Cascade strategy on hard owner delete: `"delete"` (per-row, callbacks + nested cascades; `"destroy"` is an alias), `"delete_all"` (one bulk REMOVE, no callbacks), `"nullify"` (bulk FK → null). See [Cascade Deletes](#cascade-deletes). |
| `through:` | has_many | Traverse an intermediate relation (`has_many "teams", through: "memberships"`). See [Through Associations](#through-associations). |
| `source:` | has_many + through | Relation name on the through model when it differs from the singularized name |
| `counter_cache:` | belongs_to | Maintain a `<children>_count` column on the parent (`true` or a custom column name). See [Counter Caches](#counter-caches). |
| `polymorphic:` | belongs_to | The record belongs to any of several models: stores `{name}_id` + `{name}_type`, resolved at runtime. See [Polymorphic Relations](#polymorphic-relations). |
| `as:` | has_many, has_one | Declare the inverse of a polymorphic belongs_to (`has_many "comments", as: "commentable"`) — queries are type-guarded to this class. |

## Storage & Index DSL

Class-body declarations for the multi-model and search features:

| Declaration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `columnar options?` | Declare a columnar-store model (`compression: "lz4"` default, or `"none"`). See [Analytics & Columnar Stores](analytics.md#columnar-models). |
| `column name, type, options?` | Declare a typed column on a columnar model (`nullable:`, `indexed:`) |
| `vector_index field, dimension:, metric:` | Declare an HNSW vector index (optional `m:`, `ef_construction:`, `quantization:`, `name:`). See [Search](search.md#index-dsl). |
| `fulltext_index field, ...` | Declare a fulltext index over one or more fields |
| `geo_index field` | Declare a geospatial index (`{ "lat": ..., "lon": ... }` field) |
| `index field_or_fields, options?` | Declare a secondary index (`unique:`, `type:` — `"persistent"` default / `"hash"` / `"fulltext"` / `"bloom"` / `"cuckoo"`, `name:`) |
| `connection name` | Bind the model to a named connection from `config/database.toml`. See [Multiple Databases](multi-database.md#per-model-connection). |
| `table name` | Bind the model to an **existing** SQL table and read/write its real columns instead of `_key` + `doc`. Schema (columns, types, primary key) is introspected at boot; Soli never creates or alters the table. See [Column-aware models](multi-database.md#column-aware-models-existing-databases). |

Index declarations are metadata-only at load: dev ensures them at server
boot; in production run `soli db:indexes` or create them in migrations. See
[Search — sync strategy](search.md#how-indexes-get-created-sync-strategy).

### `index` on the SQL adapters

`index` works on `postgres`, `mysql`, and `sqlite` too. A document table stores
fields inside `doc`, so Soli creates an **expression index on the JSON field**:

```soli
class Post < Model
  index "status"
  index "slug", unique: true
  index ["author", "status"]
end
```

| Adapter | What is created |
|---------|-----------------|
| Postgres | `CREATE INDEX ON posts ((doc->>'status'))` |
| SQLite | `CREATE INDEX ON posts ((doc ->> '$.status'))` |
| MySQL | a generated `STORED` column per field, then an index on it — MySQL cannot index a JSON extract directly |

Two things follow from how SQL planners work:

- **String filters use these indexes; numeric ones do not.** `.where({ "status": "open" })`
  compiles to the same JSON-text expression the index holds. A number or boolean
  filter keeps JSON comparison instead, which no expression index covers — and
  which means different things per backend: Postgres compares `jsonb` numerically,
  so `10` matches a stored `10.0`; MySQL and SQLite compare the JSON
  representation, where it does not. Store numbers consistently if you filter on
  them.
- `type:` values beyond the default (`"fulltext"`, `"bloom"`, `"cuckoo"`) and
  `vector_index` / `geo_index` are SoliDB engine features; on SQL they are
  reported as skipped rather than silently ignored.

Migrations can create the same thing with a `doc.` prefix —
`db.add_index("posts", ["doc.status"], { "unique": true })` — see
[Migrations](migrations.md#on-the-sql-adapters).

## QueryBuilder Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.where(filter, bind_vars)` | Add filter condition (ANDed with existing) |
| `.order(field, direction)` | Set sort order ("asc" or "desc") |
| `.limit(n)` | Limit results to n documents |
| `.offset(n)` | Skip first n documents |
| `.timeout(secs)` | Allow this one query `secs` seconds instead of the 10s default. See [Query timeouts](#query-timeouts). |
| `.includes(rel, ...)` | Eager load relations via subqueries |
| `.includes(rel, filter, binds)` | Eager load with filter and optional `"fields"` key |
| `.includes({ rel: [fields] })` | Eager load with field projection |
| `.includes_count(rel, ...)` | Eager load count as `<rel>_count` (HasMany/HABTM only) |
| `.find_each(block, opts?)` | Iterate the whole match one record at a time, one batch (`{ "batch_size": 1000 }`) in memory. Keyset-paged by `_key`, so it cannot be combined with `.order`/`.limit`/`.offset`/`.pluck`, with an aggregate or grouping mode, or with `grouped(...)` — each is refused rather than ignored. Returns `null`. See [Batch Iteration](#batch-iteration-find_each--in_batches). |
| `.in_batches(block, opts?)` | As `.find_each`, but the block receives the batch as an array. Alias: `find_in_batches`. |

**These also work on an already-loaded array.** A `has_many`/`has_one` accessor returns a
plain array rather than a query builder, so a Rails-style chain lands on one:

```soli
# org.contacts is already an array — order/all/includes still work on it
let sorted = org.contacts.order("name").all()
```

On an array, `.order(field, dir?)` sorts in memory, and `.all()` / `.includes(...)` return it
unchanged so the chain reads the same whether it ran in the database or not. Rows missing the
ordered field sort first.

| `.select(field, ...)` | Select specific fields on the main collection |
| `.fields(field, ...)` | Alias for `.select()` |
| `.join(rel, filter?, binds?)` | Filter by existence of related records |
| `.pluck(field, ...)` | Return only specified fields (single or array) |
| `.all` | Execute query, return all results |
| `.first` | Execute query, return the first record, or `null` when there is none |
| `.first(n)` | Execute query, return the first `n` records as an **array**. Equivalent to `.limit(n).all`; an existing `.limit()` is overridden. Not available on aggregate or `exists` queries, which return a single value rather than rows. |
| `.count` | Execute query, return count |
| `.exists` | Execute query, return boolean (true if records exist) |
| `.delete_all` | Execute as a bulk REMOVE — every matching row is deleted in a single statement. Hard delete (ignores soft-delete mode); order/limit/offset/select/group_by are ignored since they don't compose with REMOVE. Returns `null`. |
| `.update_all(hash)` | Execute as a bulk UPDATE — every matching row is patched with `hash` in a single statement, applying [merge-patch semantics](#merge-patch-semantics). Skips validations and lifecycle callbacks; order/limit/offset/select/group_by are ignored since they don't compose with UPDATE. Returns `null`. On Postgres a patch containing a *nested object* is refused — merging into a stored object needs per-row recursion, which a bulk statement cannot do. |
| `.sum(field)` | Execute aggregation, return sum of field |
| `.avg(field)` | Execute aggregation, return average of field |
| `.min(field)` | Execute aggregation, return minimum of field |
| `.max(field)` | Execute aggregation, return maximum of field |
| `.group_by(field, func, agg_field)` | Legacy grouping aggregation — returns `[{group, result}]` (chain `.all`) |
| `.group_by(fields)` | Grouped mode — field name or array of names; combine with `.aggregate` (alone: implicit count per group as `n`). Chain `.all`. See [Analytics](analytics.md#rich-aggregation-document-models). |
| `.aggregate(spec)` | Multi-aggregate spec `{ alias: [func, field] }` or `{ alias: ["count"] }` — funcs: sum, avg, min, max, count, count_distinct, median, stddev, variance |
| `.having(expr, binds?)` | Post-COLLECT filter over bare group fields / aggregate aliases. **Developer-trusted string** — never build from user input. |
| `.median(field)` / `.stddev(field)` / `.variance(field)` / `.count_distinct(field)` | Statistical aggregation (chain `.first`) |
| `.similar(query, field?, k?, opts?)` | Vector similarity search — pushes down to the HNSW index when a `vector_index` is declared; `opts: { "exact": true }` forces exact client-side cosine. See [Search](search.md#vector-search-similar). |
| `.time_bucket(interval, aggs?)` | Timeseries models only: group into fixed time buckets with per-bucket aggregates (chain `.all`). See [Timeseries Models](#timeseries-models). |
| `.paginate(hash)` | Terminal: fetch paginated results + metadata. See [Pagination](#pagination) below. |
| `.to_query` | Return the generated SDBQL string (for debugging) |
| `record.traverse(EdgeModel, opts?)` | Instance method: start a graph-traversal QueryBuilder from a saved record. See [Graph Models](#graph-models-edges-and-traversal). |
| `record.shortest_path(other, via:, direction?)` | Instance method, executes immediately: vertices along the shortest path (`[]` when unconnected). |

## Query timeouts

Every read reaches SoliDB over HTTP, and that client gives a request **10 seconds**.
The limit is deliberately tight — it is the backstop that keeps a stalled
connection from pinning a worker — but a genuine long-running query outgrows it:
a report over a large collection, a multi-aggregate `group_by`, a `db:import`-sized
scan. Such a query fails with `Error: HTTP error: error sending request for url …`
after ten seconds, no matter how healthy the database is.

`.timeout(secs)` raises the limit for one query:

```soli
# A slow report gets two minutes; every other query on the process
# keeps the 10s default.
let rows = Order
    .where({ "created_at": { "gte": start_of_year } })
    .group_by(["region", "channel"])
    .aggregate({ "revenue": ["sum", "total"], "n": ["count"] })
    .timeout(120)
    .all()
```

- **Seconds, `Int` or `Float`** — `.timeout(0.5)` is a valid half-second budget.
  A zero, negative, or non-numeric value raises rather than being ignored, so a
  typo cannot silently leave the 10s default in place.
- **Chainable and position-independent**, like `.limit`. It also exists as a
  static entry point, so `Order.timeout(120).all()` works without a `.where`.
- **Scoped to the one query.** The override is installed for that request and
  reverted as soon as it finishes, including on error — it never leaks into the
  next query.
- **Lower it too.** Nothing stops `.timeout(2)` on a query you would rather see
  fail fast than have a user wait on.

Inside a `grouped(fn() { … })` block the reads become a single request, and the
batch runs under the **largest** `.timeout` any member asked for — one slow
member is not capped by the fast reads sharing its round-trip. A raw
`db.query` **read** against the same host and database joins that batch, so a
sibling `Model.timeout(120)` covers it; a write via `db.query` still runs
immediately, like Model `create`/`update`/`delete`.

```soli
grouped(fn() {
  @summary = Order.group_by(["region"]).timeout(120).all   # the slow one
  @tags    = Tag.all                                       # rides along
  @heavy   = db.query("FOR d IN orders COLLECT … RETURN d") # joins the batch
})
# one request, 120s of room
```

The QueryBuilder form does not apply to a `Solidb` client. Raise that path
with `db.timeout(secs).query(sdbql)` (persists on the client until you change
it) or a per-call options hash:

```soli
rows = db.timeout(60).query(sdbql)
rows = db.query(sdbql, binds, { "timeout": 60 })
```

In `--dev`, `grouped` does not coalesce (so the query log stays one row per
read). Put `.timeout` on each slow query, including `db.query`.

**On the SQL adapters (Postgres / MySQL / SQLite) `.timeout` has no effect.**
Those adapters talk to the database over their own connection pool rather than
HTTP, so the 10s cap this option lifts does not exist there and there is no
statement timeout to set in its place. The call is accepted so a query stays
portable across adapters, but on SQL the query runs as long as the server lets
it. Use the server's own knob — Postgres `statement_timeout`, MySQL
`max_execution_time` — to bound it.

## Pagination

`Model.paginate(hash)` (static) and `.paginate(hash)` (chainable on a QueryBuilder) are **terminal** methods that execute the query with pagination and return a hash with both records and pagination metadata.

### Arguments

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `page` | `1` | Page number (1-indexed, clamped to valid range) |
| `per` | `25` | Results per page |

### Return Value

```soli
{
  "records": [...],                // Array of model instances for this page
  "pagination": {
    "page":        1,              // Current page (clamped)
    "per":         25,             // Results per page
    "total":       100,            // Total matching records (unpaginated)
    "total_pages": 4               // Total number of pages
  }
}
```

### Usage

Chain from any QueryBuilder — all filters, includes, ordering, etc. are preserved:

```soli
let result = Contact
    .search(@q)
    .includes("organisation")
    .order("name", "asc")
    .paginate({ page: this._page_param(), per: 25 });

@contacts   = result["records"];
@pagination = result["pagination"];
```

The paginate method:
1. Runs `count` first to get the total matching records
2. Computes `total_pages = ceil(total / per)`
3. Clamps `page` to valid range (1..total_pages)
4. Sets `offset = (page - 1) * per` and `limit = per`
5. Fetches the records
6. Returns the result hash

If `total` is 0, `total_pages` is set to 1 and `page` is clamped to 1 (returning an empty records array with no error).

Direct static call also works:

```soli
let result = Contact.paginate({ page: 2, per: 10 });
```

## Mass Assignment Protection

By default, `Model.create(hash)` and `instance.update(hash)` write **every** key in the supplied hash straight to the document. If `hash` came from a request body, that includes any field a client decides to send — `role`, `is_admin`, `password_digest`, etc. Declare `attr_accessible(...)` on the model to lock down which keys mass-assign accepts.

```soli
class User < Model
  # Variadic form
  attr_accessible("name", "email", "bio")

  # …or pass a single array — equivalent
  # attr_accessible(["name", "email", "bio"])
end

User.create({
  "name":  "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "role":  "admin"   # silently dropped — not in the whitelist
});
```

Filtering applies to every mass-assign path: `Model.create(hash)`, `Model.update(id, hash)`, `instance.update(hash)`, `instance.save(hash)`. Non-permitted keys are dropped before validation runs and before the document is written, so they cannot be probed via validation errors either.

**Empty list = full lock-down.** `attr_accessible([])` declares that the model accepts no mass-assigned attributes; everything must be set by trusted server code via direct field assignment (`user.role = "admin"`).

**Models without a declaration keep the legacy "all keys accepted" behaviour** for backwards compatibility. New models that take request data should always declare `attr_accessible`. The CLAUDE.md security guidance recommends auditing every `Model.create`/`Model.update` call site against an explicit whitelist.

**How this relates to `permit()`.** [`permit(params, shape)`](/docs/core-concepts/request-params#permit) is the *primary* mass-assignment filter — it lives in the controller, where assignability is actually decided (an admin form and a public form permit different fields against the same model), and it understands nested shapes. `attr_accessible` is optional defense-in-depth for high-stakes models (`User` blocking `role`/`is_admin` even if a controller forgets to filter) and covers paths that bypass controllers — jobs, websocket handlers, a raw `Model.create(params)`. Both are whitelists, so the effective result is their **intersection**: if you use both on a model, `attr_accessible` must list every top-level key any controller permits, or the value is dropped at the model layer. `attr_accessible` is flat — for nested assignable fields, list the top-level key and let `permit` control the sub-shape. In `--dev`, a mass-assign that hits the whitelist logs `[WARN] attr_accessible on User dropped mass-assign key(s): …` so the drift is visible.

For controller-side filtering (when you'd rather hand-pick keys at the boundary), the existing `hash.slice(["a", "b"])` returns a new hash with only the listed keys — handy when you need different whitelists per action:

```soli
def update
  let user = User.find(req["params"]["id"]);
  let safe = req["json"].slice(["name", "bio"]);
  user.update(safe);
  redirect("/users/" + user._key);
end
```

## Validations

Define validation rules in your model class:

```soli
class User < Model
  validates("email", { "presence": true, "uniqueness": true })
  validates("name", { "presence": true, "min_length": 2, "max_length": 100 })
  validates("age", { "numericality": true, "min": 0, "max": 150 })
  validates("website", { "format": "^https?://" })
end
```

### Validation Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `presence: true` | Field must be present and not empty |
| `uniqueness: true` | Field value must be unique in collection |
| `min_length: n` | String must be at least n characters |
| `max_length: n` | String must be at most n characters |
| `format: "regex"` | String must match regex pattern |
| `numericality: true` | Value must be a number |
| `min: n` | Number must be >= n |
| `max: n` | Number must be <= n |
| `inclusion: [...]` (or `one_of: [...]`) | Value must be one of the listed values — `"is not included in the list"` |
| `type: "string"` | Value must have that type: `"string"`, `"int"`/`"integer"`, `"float"`, `"number"`, `"bool"`/`"boolean"`, `"array"`, `"hash"` — `"must be a <type>"` |
| `allow_nil: true` (or `allow_null: true`) | Skip the whole rule when the value is nil or absent |
| `custom: "method_name"` | Call an instance method of the model — see [Custom Validators](#custom-validators) |
| `custom: fn(value, record) { ... }` | Call a closure — same return rules as the method form |
| `on: "create"` / `on: "update"` | Only run the rule for that operation |
| `if: fn(record) { ... }` | Only run the rule when the closure is truthy |
| `unless: fn(record) { ... }` | Skip the rule when the closure is truthy |

Options are **strict**: an unknown key (`"within": [...]`, a typo like `"presense"`) or a known key with a
wrong-typed value (`"min_length": "3"`) raises when the class loads, with a message listing the known
options. A misspelt rule used to be ignored silently — it read like protection and checked nothing.

### Inclusion, Type and Nil

```soli
class Invoice < Model
  validates("status", { "presence": true, "inclusion": ["draft", "sent", "paid"] })
  validates("priority", { "one_of": [1, 2, 3] })     # compared by type: "1" is not 1
  validates("paid", { "type": "boolean" })
  validates("nickname", { "allow_nil": true, "min_length": 3 })
end

invoice = Invoice.create({ "status": "pending", "priority": "1", "paid": "yes" })
# invoice._errors:
#   status:   is not included in the list
#   priority: is not included in the list
#   paid:     must be a boolean
```

`inclusion` and `type` skip a nil or absent value — pair them with `presence: true` when the field is
required. `allow_nil: true` goes further and skips every check of that `validates` call (presence, length,
custom…) when the value is nil or absent.

### Custom Validators

`custom: "method_name"` calls that instance method on a record built from the data being validated, so
`@field` reads work. The method can be declared anywhere in the class, including under `private`. It fails
the field by:

- pushing `{"field": "...", "message": "..."}` entries onto `@_errors` (any field, any number of them);
- returning `false` — reported as `"is invalid"`;
- returning a String — reported as that message.

Returning `nil` or `true` passes. A method that declares one parameter receives the field's value.

```soli
class Event < Model
  validates("ends_at", { "custom": "_ends_after_start" })
  validates("title", { "custom": "_no_shouting" })
  validates("code", { "custom": fn(value, record) { value.nil? || value.starts_with?("EV-") ? true : "must start with EV-" } })

  private

  def _ends_after_start
    return true if @ends_at.nil? || @starts_at.nil?

    @_errors = @_errors ?? []
    @_errors.push({ "field": "ends_at", "message": "must be after starts_at" }) if @ends_at <= @starts_at
  end

  def _no_shouting(title)
    return "can't be all caps" if title == title.upcase

    true
  end
end
```

The closure form, `custom: fn(value, record) { ... }`, receives the field value and the attribute hash and
follows the same return rules. Before, `custom:` was accepted but never ran.

### Conditional and Per-Operation Rules

Every rule in a `validates(...)` call can be restricted to one persistence
operation with `on:`, or gated on the record's data with an `if:` / `unless:`
closure. The closure receives the attribute hash being validated (declare
zero parameters if you don't need it) and its truthiness decides.

```soli
class User < Model
  # Only enforced when the record is first created
  validates("password", { "presence": true, "min_length": 8, "on": "create" })

  # Only enforced on updates (e.g. a moderation field set later)
  validates("reviewer", { "presence": true, "on": "update" })

  # Enforced only for a subset of records
  validates("company_name", { "presence": true, "if": fn(record) { record["kind"] == "business" } })

  # Skipped for privileged records
  validates("bio", { "presence": true, "unless": fn(record) { record["role"] == "admin" } })
end
```

`Model.create` counts as `create`; `instance.update()` and `instance.save()`
on a record that already has a `_key` count as `update`. `if:` and `unless:`
can be combined on one call — the rule runs only when `if:` is truthy **and**
`unless:` is falsy. Passing anything other than `"create"`/`"update"` to
`on:`, or a non-function to `if:`/`unless:`, raises at class-load time
rather than silently running the rule unconditionally.

### Validation Results

`Model.create()` always returns an instance of the class. On validation or
database failure, the instance is **not persisted** and its `_errors` field
holds an array of error entries. On success, `_errors` is `nil`.

```soli
user = User.create({ "email": "" });

if user._errors
  for error in user._errors
    print(error["field"] + ": " + error["message"]);
  end
else
  print("Created user: " + user.id);
end
```

### Atomic uniqueness

`uniqueness: true` issues a `SELECT … LIMIT 1` before the write, but that
check is **best-effort**: two concurrent `User.create({ "email": "x" })`
calls can both pass the SELECT and both insert. To make uniqueness atomic,
declare a unique index on the column at deploy time and let the database
enforce it. Soli detects the resulting violation from `Model.create`,
`instance.save`, `instance.update`, `Model.upsert`, and
`Model.find_or_create_by`, and turns it into the same `_errors` entry the
SELECT path produces (`field: "has already been taken"`), so callers
handle the race identically.

```soli
# Declare the index on the model — it is created on every backend:
class User < Model
  index "email", unique: true
  validates("email", { "uniqueness": true })
end
```

Without the index, the SELECT is the only line of defense and the race is
silently lost.

**On the SQL adapters** the database's own error is classified, so a violation
becomes a field error even for a constraint the model never declared:

| Violation | Reported as |
|-----------|-------------|
| unique index / constraint | `{ field, "has already been taken" }` |
| foreign key | `{ field, "must reference an existing record" }` |
| `NOT NULL` column | `{ field, "can't be blank" }` |
| `CHECK` constraint | `{ field, "is invalid" }` |

The field comes from whatever the database names — Postgres reports the column in
`DETAIL`, SQLite names `table.column` (or the index, for an expression index),
MySQL names the index — and falls back to `_base` when there is nothing to go on.
Anything that is *not* a constraint violation is still reported as-is, so a
connection failure never masquerades as a validation error.

A `uniqueness` rule on a SQL adapter also runs the rest of its `validates` call:
`validates("email", { "uniqueness": true, "format": "email" })` checks the format
too (the SQL path used to skip that call's `format`/`numericality`/`min`/`max`).

## Callbacks

Define lifecycle callbacks to run code at specific points. The method name
can be passed as a string or a symbol:

```soli
class User < Model
  before_save("normalize_email")   # both strings and symbols work
  before_save(:normalize_email)    # Ruby-style symbol shorthand
  after_create("send_welcome_email")
  before_update("log_changes")
  after_delete("cleanup_related")

  def normalize_email()        this.email = this.email.downcase;
  end

  def send_welcome_email()        # Send email logic
  end
end
```

### Available Callbacks

| Callback | When it runs |
|----------|--------------|
| `before_save` | Before create or update |
| `after_save` | After create or update |
| `before_create` | Before inserting new record |
| `after_create` | After inserting new record |
| `before_update` | Before updating existing record |
| `after_update` | After updating existing record |
| `before_delete` | Before deleting record |
| `after_delete` | After deleting record |

### Firing order per persistence method

Both class-level methods (`Model.create`, `Model.update`) and instance-level mutators run the matching callbacks. Rails-style: the `_save` callbacks fire on every persistence path, plus the more specific event for the operation.

| Method | Before-callbacks (in order) | DB write | After-callbacks (in order) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| `Model.create(attrs)` | `before_save` → `before_create` | INSERT | `after_create` → `after_save` |
| `Model.update(id, attrs)` | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.save([attrs])` — new record (no `_key`) | `before_save` → `before_create` | INSERT | `after_create` → `after_save` |
| `instance.save([attrs])` — persisted record | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.update(attrs)` | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.restore()` | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.increment(field, n?)` | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.decrement(field, n?)` | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.touch()` | `before_save` → `before_update` | UPDATE | `after_update` → `after_save` |
| `instance.delete()` (soft + hard) | `before_delete` | UPDATE / DELETE | `after_delete` |

After-callbacks only fire when the persist call succeeds. If the native method returns `false` (validation or DB error) the after-callbacks are skipped and the instance carries `_errors`.

Every callback in the table fires on both engines. A callback declared as a
*method name* runs on the bytecode VM in production; a **closure-form**
callback (`before_save do … end`) runs on the tree-walking interpreter, because
it needs the scope it was declared in. The handler falls back automatically and
before any write happens, so the only difference is speed — the callbacks
themselves, and their ordering, are identical either way.

On hard deletes, [`dependent:` cascades](#cascade-deletes) run between
`before_delete` and the owner row's removal — a `before_delete` veto skips
them, and a failing cascade aborts the owner delete before `after_delete`.

### Vetoing persistence from a `before_*` callback

Returning `false` from any `before_*` callback aborts the operation. The native DB write is skipped, after-callbacks don't run, and the instance picks up an `_errors` entry of the form `[{"message": "before_<event> callback returned false; persistence aborted"}]`. Callers receive `false` (or, for `Model.create` / `Model.update`, the instance with `_errors` populated) so they can branch on the result identically to a validation failure.

```soli
class Audited < Model
  before_save("can_save")  # symbols also work: before_save(:can_save)

  def can_save
    return false if User.current.is_nil?  # returns false → save() / update() aborts
  end
end
```

The veto fires at the first `false` — subsequent before-callbacks in the chain don't run. Use this for authorization gates, integrity checks, or any "deny by default" pattern. Mutating-only callbacks (the common case) just don't return `false` and run end-to-end as before.

## Attachments

First-class file attachments use `has_one_attached` / `has_many_attached`. They default to the **disk** service (`./storage/attachments`, or `SOLI_ATTACHMENTS_PATH`) so a Postgres/SQLite app does not need SoliDB to keep files. Set `service: "s3"` (bucket `SOLI_ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET` or `S3_BUCKET`) or `service: "solidb"` to store elsewhere. `SOLI_ATTACHMENTS_SERVICE` changes the default for every `has_*_attached` declaration.

```soli
class User < Model
  has_one_attached("avatar")   # disk, 10 MiB, safe default content types
  has_many_attached("photos", {
    "service": "s3",
    "content_types": ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"],
    "max_size": 5_000_000
  })
end

user.attach_avatar(file)       # multipart hash from find_uploaded_file / LiveView upload
user.avatar_url()
user.detach_avatar()
# destroy / User.delete(id) purges the blobs automatically
```

### Large files: resumable and direct uploads

An ordinary attachment upload is one request buffered in memory under the body cap. Two other paths exist for big files.

**Resumable (tus 1.0.0).** Turn it on in `config/routes.sl`:

```soli
resumable_uploads()                       # /tus, 1 GiB cap, needs a session
resumable_uploads({"path": "/uploads/tus", "max_size": 5_000_000_000, "max_per_owner": 5})
```

Options: `path`, `max_size`, `max_active` (stored uploads overall, 200), `max_per_owner` (stored uploads per session, 20), `expires_in` (seconds, 86400), `dir` (`SOLI_TUS_DIR`, default `./storage/tus`), `require_session` (true). A finished upload counts toward both caps until `tus_take` + `attach_<field>` consumes it or it expires, so finishing uploads does not free room for more. "Session" means one the session store knows: a made-up `session_id` cookie is refused (401), and an upload stays its owner's across session writes, the `cookie` driver included. An upload can only be taken by its own session, complete and unexpired — `attach_<field>` checks a `tus_id` the same way even when the hash did not come from `tus_take`, and reads the size and type from the upload, not from the hash.

The endpoint speaks tus creation, `HEAD` offset, `PATCH`, termination and expiration, so any tus client works — with `tus-js-client`:

```js
const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
  endpoint: "/tus",
  chunkSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024,
  metadata: { filename: file.name, filetype: file.type },
  onSuccess: () => fetch("/videos", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({ upload_id: upload.url.split("/").pop() }) })
})
upload.start()   // upload.abort() pauses; start() again resumes from the server's offset
```

Bytes go to disk as each chunk arrives, so memory is one chunk, not the file. An upload belongs to the session that created it; another session's is a `404`. When the last chunk lands, attach it:

```soli
file = tus_take(params["upload_id"])          # {filename, content_type, size, tus_id}; raises unless finished
video.attach_file(file)                        # disk and s3 move/stream it: never loaded into memory
```

A disk attachment renames the file into place; an S3 attachment streams it a megabyte at a time. A SoliDB uploader, or any uploader with an image transform (`format`, `max_width`), needs the bytes, so the file is loaded (up to 64 MiB) first. The uploader's `content_types` and `max_size` are checked either way. `tus_discard(id)` drops an upload you do not want; unfinished ones expire after `expires_in`.

**Direct to storage (S3).** For an S3 attachment the browser can send the file to the bucket without touching your server:

```soli
# POST /videos/presign
info = direct_upload_start(video, "clip", params["filename"], params["content_type"], params["size"].to_i)
return render_json(info, 422) unless info["error"].nil?     # {"error": "..."} when refused
render_json(info)      # {"id", "url", "method": "PUT", "headers": {...}, "expires_in"}

# POST /videos/attached — after the browser PUT the file to info["url"] with info["headers"]
ok = direct_upload_finish(video, "clip", params["id"])
```

`direct_upload_start` checks the declared type and size against the uploader and returns a presigned `PUT` (default 15 minutes, at most an hour). **The URL does not pin the size or type — S3 takes what it is sent.** So `direct_upload_finish` asks the bucket what it holds under that id, re-checks the limits against *that*, deletes an object that breaks them, and only then records the blob. `direct_upload_finish` only accepts an id that `direct_upload_start` issued, in the same session, for the same field (the last ten are kept in the session), so a caller cannot claim, or get deleted, a blob that is not theirs; the browser must send the session cookie on both calls. An id that was never finished leaves an orphan object; add a bucket lifecycle rule for the `<collection>/` prefix. Set `S3_ENDPOINT` for MinIO and friends.

### The default content-type allow-list

`uploader(...)` **requires** a `content_types` array. `has_one_attached` /
`has_many_attached` are the low-ceremony form and fall back to a curated
allow-list instead: common images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, HEIC, BMP,
TIFF), PDF, plain text, Markdown and CSV, JSON, Zip, the Office formats, and
common audio/video.

> **Upgrading:** `has_*_attached` used to accept *any* content type when the
> declaration named none. If your app stores something outside the curated list
> — most likely `image/svg+xml`, `text/html`, or `text/xml` — those uploads now
> get rejected. Name the types you need with `content_types` to opt back in;
> the exclusions exist for a reason, so weigh the XSS note below first.

That default deliberately **excludes every type a browser executes script
from** — `text/html`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `image/svg+xml`, `text/xml` —
because the blob route serves attachments from your application's own origin.
Passing `content_types` narrows the list; there is no way to widen it to "any
type".

The blob route also sends `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and
`Content-Disposition: attachment` for anything that is not an inline-safe
image, so a stored file cannot be re-typed into a script by the browser.

The older `uploader(name, options)` form still works and still defaults to SoliDB blobs (`service: "solidb"`). Same generated methods: `attach_<field>`, `detach_<field>`, `<field>_url` / `<field>_urls`.

**Single attachment (`uploader`):**

**Single attachment:**

```soli
class Contact < Model
  uploader("photo", {
    "multiple":      false,
    "content_types": ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"],
    "max_size":      2_000_000,
    "collection":    "contact_photos"   # optional; defaults to <snake>_<field>s
  })
end
```

Auto-generated on each instance: `attach_<field>(file)`, `detach_<field>([blob_id])`, `<field>_url()` (single), `<field>_urls()` (multiple). Failures populate `_errors` on the record.

**Multiple attachments** (array of blob ids in `<name>_blob_ids`):

```soli
class Contact < Model
  uploader("document", {
    "multiple":      true,
    "content_types": ["application/pdf", "image/jpeg", "image/png",
             "application/zip", "text/csv"],
    "max_size":      10_000_000,
    "collection":    "contact_documents"
  })
end
```

```soli
# POST /contacts/:id/documents (HTML form → redirect+flash)
def attach_document
  contact = Contact.find(params.id)
  file = find_uploaded_file(req, "document")
  if file.nil?
    flash("error", "Pick a file before submitting.")
  elsif contact.attach_document(file)
    flash("success", "Document filed.")
  else
    flash("error", (contact._errors[0] ?? { "message": "Upload failed." })["message"])
  end
  redirect("/contacts/#{contact._key}")
end

# POST /contacts/:id/document/:blob_id/delete
def detach_document
  contact = Contact.find(params.id)
  if contact.detach_document(params.blob_id)
    flash("success", "Document removed.")
  else
    flash("error", "Document not found on this record.")
  end
  redirect("/contacts/#{contact._key}")
end
```

### Uploader options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `multiple` | `false` | `true` keeps an array of blob ids (`<field>_blob_ids`); `false` keeps one (`<field>_blob_id`). |
| `content_types` | required for `uploader`; a safe default list for `has_*_attached` | Allow-list of MIME types. Anything else is rejected before storage. The default never includes a script-executing type — see above. |
| `max_size` | — (required) | Hard cap in bytes. Above this → `_errors` populated, no blob stored. |
| `service` | `solidb` for `uploader`; `disk` for `has_*_attached` | `"disk"`, `"s3"`, or `"solidb"`. |
| `collection` | `<snake>_<field>s` | SoliDB collection (solidb) or key prefix (disk/s3). |
| `format` | — | Convert image uploads to `"jpeg"`, `"png"`, or `"webp"` **before storage**. Non-image uploads (PDF, csv, …) are never converted. |
| `quality` | `82` | Encoder quality (1–100) for lossy formats (`jpeg`, `webp`). |
| `max_width` / `max_height` | — | Downscale the original to fit within these pixel bounds before storage, preserving aspect ratio. Never upscales. |

#### Transform the original before storage

To avoid storing large originals (e.g. heavy PNG photos), declare a `format`
and/or size caps. The framework decodes the upload, optionally downscales it,
re-encodes it to the target format, and stores the result — updating the blob's
content-type and filename extension to match. WebP is encoded **lossy** (via
libwebp) so photos shrink dramatically; JPEG quality is honoured too.

```soli
class Listing < Model
  uploader("photo", {
    "content_types": ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"],
    "max_size":      10_000_000,   # accept up to 10 MB on the way in
    "format":        "webp",       # …but store a lossy WebP
    "quality":       80,
    "max_width":     1600,         # downscale huge originals
    "max_height":    1600
  })
end
```

A 4 MB PNG uploaded here lands in storage as a downscaled ~200 KB WebP. The
transform only runs for image content-types — a PDF in a multi-file uploader is
stored byte-for-byte. If the bytes can't be decoded as an image, the original is
stored unchanged so an upload is never blocked by a transform failure.

> The same lossy WebP/quality encoding powers the read-time URL transform
> pipeline (`photo_url(...)` with `?fmt=webp&w=...`), so you can also keep a
> larger original and convert per-request instead.

For drag-and-drop / AJAX flows that prefer JSON 204/422 over redirects, use `uploads("contacts", "document")` in `config/routes.sl` instead — that auto-mounts a generic `AttachmentsController` for upload, download, and per-blob delete.

**Cleanup on destroy** — `record.delete()` and `Model.delete(id)` purge every attachment (disk, S3, and SoliDB) before the row is removed. `detach_all_uploads(record)` remains if you need to clear files without deleting the record.

```soli
def destroy
  contact = Contact.find(params.id)
  detach_all_uploads(contact) unless contact.nil?
  Contact.delete(params.id)
  redirect("/contacts")
end
```

**Introspection** — `model_uploader_config(class_or_name, field)` returns `{ name, multiple, content_types, max_size, collection }` (or `null`); `model_uploader_fields(class_or_name)` lists the declared field names.

## Relationships

Declare associations using the built-in DSL. Association names accept strings
or symbols:

```soli
class User < Model
  has_many("posts")      # strings and symbols both work
  has_many(:posts)       # Ruby-style symbol shorthand
  has_one("profile")
end

class Post < Model
  belongs_to("user")
  has_many("comments")
end
```

### Naming Conventions

The DSL applies Rails-style naming conventions automatically:

| Declaration | Related Class | Collection | Foreign Key |
|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| `has_many("posts")` | `Post` | `posts` | `user_id` (owner + `_id`) |
| `has_one("profile")` | `Profile` | `profiles` | `user_id` (owner + `_id`) |
| `belongs_to("user")` | `User` | `users` | `user_id` (name + `_id`) |
| `has_and_belongs_to_many("tags")` | `Tag` | `tags` | join table `posts_tags`, FKs `post_id` / `tag_id` |

Override defaults with an options hash:

```soli
class Post < Model
  belongs_to("author", { "class_name": "User", "foreign_key": "author_id" })

  has_and_belongs_to_many("labels", {
    "class_name": "Tag",
    "join_table": "post_labels",
    "foreign_key": "post_id",
    "association_foreign_key": "label_id"
  })
end
```

### Eager Loading (includes)

Preload related records to avoid N+1 queries. Uses LET subqueries with MERGE:

```soli
# Load users with their posts and profiles in a single query
users = User.includes("posts", "profile").all

# Combine with where clauses
active = User.where("active = @a", { "a": true }).includes("posts").first

# Inspect the generated query
print(User.includes("posts").to_query)
# => FOR doc IN users LET _rel_posts = (FOR rel IN posts FILTER rel.user_id == doc._key RETURN rel) RETURN MERGE(doc, {posts: _rel_posts})
```

- `has_many` includes return an array of related documents
- `has_one` and `belongs_to` includes return a single document (via `FIRST()`)

After `.all`, the preloaded data is cached on each instance: subsequent `instance.<rel>` reads return the cached value without issuing another query. This applies to `has_and_belongs_to_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one`, and polymorphic relations. (`has_many` accessors still return a chainable `QueryBuilder`, so they are not served from the preload cache — use `.where(...).all` if you want a materialised array.)

### Join Filtering

Filter records by the existence of related records. Unlike `includes`, `join` does **not** preload the related data — it only filters:

```soli
# Find users who have at least one post
users_with_posts = User.join("posts").all

# Find users who have published posts
count = User.join("posts", "published = @p", { "p": true }).count

# Hash form — portable on SoliDB and every SQL adapter
count = User.join("posts", { "published": true }).count
count = User.join("posts", { "views": { "gt": 10 } }).count

# Chain with other query methods
recent = User.join("posts").order("created_at", "desc").limit(10).all
```

This is equivalent to ActiveRecord's `joins` — use `includes` when you need the related data, and `join` when you only need to filter by existence.

### Filtered Includes

Filter included relations to load only matching related records:

```soli
# Only load published posts for each user
users = User.includes("posts", "published = @p", { "p": true }).all

# Hash form — portable on SoliDB and every SQL adapter (document + column)
visible = User.includes("posts", { "published": true }).all
recent  = User.includes("posts", { "where": { "views": { "gt": 10 } } }).all

# Inspect the generated query
print(User.includes("posts", "published = @p", { "p": true }).to_query)
# => ... LET _rel_posts = (FOR rel IN posts FILTER rel.user_id == doc._key AND rel.published == @p RETURN rel) ...
```

When a hash filter on `includes` is evaluated in memory, `like` / `ilike` use a
linear-time matcher (a pattern like `%a%a%a%…` can no longer blow up), and `_`
matches one **character**, not one byte — so it matches `é` as SQL does.

Combine a filter with field projection using the `"fields"` key in the bind hash:

```soli
# Only load title and body of published posts
users = User.includes("posts", "published = @p", {
  "p": true,
  "fields": ["title", "body"]
}).all
# => ... RETURN {title: rel.title, body: rel.body} ...
```

### Includes with Field Projection

Use a hash argument to select specific fields on included relations (without filtering):

```soli
# Only load title and body from posts
users = User.includes({ "posts": ["title", "body"] }).all
# => ... LET _rel_posts = (FOR rel IN posts FILTER rel.user_id == doc._key RETURN {title: rel.title, body: rel.body}) ...
```

### Chaining Multiple Includes

Chain `.includes()` calls to eagerly load multiple relations with different options:

```soli
# Filtered posts + unfiltered profile
users = User.includes("posts", "published = @p", { "p": true })
  .includes("profile")
  .all
```

### Counting Relations (includes_count)

When you only need the *count* of a relation (not the rows), `.includes_count()` adds a single `LET _rel_<name>_count = LENGTH(...)` subquery to the parent and exposes the result as a `<name>_count` field on each instance. Cheaper than `.includes()` when you only render counts:

```soli
# Each Category gets a `products_count` integer field, in one round-trip
cats = Category.includes_count("products").all
print(cats[0].products_count)
# => 3

# Combine with .includes() and other chain steps
q = Author.where("active = @a", { "a": true })
  .includes("profile")
  .includes_count("posts")
  .order("name", "asc")
  .all
```

- Only valid for `has_many` and `has_and_belongs_to_many` relations. Calling it on `belongs_to`, `has_one`, or polymorphic relations raises an error at registration time (the count is always 0 or 1, so the API doesn't earn its keep there).
- The exposed field is always `<relation_name>_count`. Reads are O(1) — it's just an integer field on the instance, no extra query.

### Field Selection (select / fields)

Use `.select()` (or its alias `.fields()`) to return only specific fields from the main collection. `_key` is always included automatically for identity:

```soli
# Only return name and email
users = User.select("name", "email").all
# => FOR doc IN users RETURN {name: doc.name, email: doc.email, _key: doc._key}

# .fields() is an alias
users = User.fields("name", "email").all
# => same query

# Combine with other query methods
users = User.where("active = @a", { "a": true })
  .select("name", "email")
  .order("name")
  .limit(10)
  .all

# Combine with includes
users = User.select("name", "email").includes("posts").all
# => ... RETURN MERGE({name: doc.name, email: doc.email, _key: doc._key}, {posts: _rel_posts})

# Full combo: select + filtered includes with field projection
users = User.select("name")
  .includes("posts", "published = @p", { "p": true, "fields": ["title"] })
  .all
```

### Has And Belongs To Many

Many-to-many associations use a join table that stores `(<foreign_key>, <association_foreign_key>)` rows:

```soli
class Post < Model
  has_and_belongs_to_many("tags")
end

class Tag < Model
  has_and_belongs_to_many("posts")
end
```

Both classes declare the relation. The default join table is the alphabetical concatenation of the two pluralized class names — here `posts_tags`. The default foreign keys are `post_id` and `tag_id`.

**Read** — `post.tags` returns an array of related `Tag` instances:

```soli
post = Post.find(post_id)
tags = post.tags  # => [Tag, Tag, ...]
```

**Add / remove** — auto-generated mutators insert/delete join-table rows. The method name is `add_<singular>` / `remove_<singular>` derived from the relation name:

```soli
post.add_tag(tag)              # accepts a Tag instance
post.add_tag("tag_key")        # …or a raw _key
post.add_tag([tag1, tag2])     # …or an array
post.add_tag(tag1, tag2)       # …or variadic args

post.remove_tag(tag)
post.remove_tag([tag1, tag2])
```

**Shovel operator (`<<`)** — equivalent to `add_<singular>`, returns the (refreshed) relation:

```soli
post.tags << tag                # appends one tag, returns post.tags
```

**Eager loading** uses a two-stage subquery through the join table:

```soli
posts = Post.includes("tags").all
# => ... LET _rel_tags = (FOR jt IN posts_tags FILTER jt.post_id == doc._key
#                          FOR rel IN tags FILTER rel._key == jt.tag_id RETURN rel) ...
```

**Existence filtering** with `.join()`:

```soli
tagged_posts = Post.join("tags").all              # posts that have at least one tag
tutorials = Post.join("tags", "name = @n", { "n": "tutorial" }).all
```

**Overrides** — supply an options hash to customize the join:

```soli
class Article < Model
  has_and_belongs_to_many("labels", {
    "class_name": "Tag",
    "join_table": "article_labels",
    "foreign_key": "article_id",
    "association_foreign_key": "tag_id"
  })
end
```

### Cascade Deletes

Declare what happens to associated records when their owner is **hard-deleted**
with `dependent:` on `has_many`/`has_one`:

```soli
class User < Model
  has_many "posts", dependent: "delete"       # per-row: callbacks, nested cascades
  has_many "events", dependent: "delete_all"  # one bulk REMOVE: no callbacks
  has_many "drafts", dependent: "nullify"     # one bulk UPDATE: fk → null
  has_one  "profile", dependent: "delete"
end
```

Semantics:

- **Ordering** mirrors Rails: `before_delete` runs first (a `false` veto aborts
  the cascades too), then each `dependent:` relation in declaration order, then
  the owner row is removed, then `after_delete`.
- **`"delete"`** (alias `"destroy"`) loads each child and deletes it through
  the interpreter — child callbacks, nested cascades, the child's own
  soft-delete semantics, and counter-cache decrements all apply. A child veto
  or error aborts the remaining cascade *and* the owner delete.
- **`"delete_all"`** issues one bulk `REMOVE`: no callbacks, hard delete even
  for soft-delete child models, no nesting.
- **`"nullify"`** issues one bulk `UPDATE` setting the FK to `null`.
- **Soft-delete owners never cascade** — a soft `delete()` keeps children, so
  `restore()` has nothing to un-do.
- `Model.delete(id)` on a class that declares `dependent:` routes through the
  full instance flow (cascades — and, as a side effect, delete callbacks —
  fire). Bulk writes (`Model.delete_all`, `Model.where(...).delete_all`,
  `update_all`, `prune`) **never** cascade, matching Rails.
- Cycles terminate: a document already being deleted higher up the chain is
  skipped, and recursion is capped at 32 levels.
- There is no per-operation rollback; wrap the delete in `Model.transaction`
  when the cascade must be atomic (every document write inside participates).

### Through Associations

`has_many through:` traverses an intermediate relation — the document-DB
equivalent of Rails' join-model association:

```soli
class User < Model
  has_many "memberships"
  has_many "teams", through: "memberships"
  # source: when the relation name doesn't match the through model's relation
  has_many("employers", {"through": "memberships", "source": "company"})
end

class Membership < Model
  belongs_to "user"
  belongs_to "team"
end

user.teams                                  # chainable QueryBuilder
user.teams.where("active == @a", {"a": true}).order("name").count()
```

How it works and what to know:

- The accessor returns a **chainable QueryBuilder** over the target
  collection, filtered by a single-query membership subquery
  (`doc._key IN (FOR jt IN memberships FILTER jt.user_id == @k RETURN jt.team_id)`)
  — no N+1, and chained `.where`/`.order`/`.count`/`.sum` all compose.
- The **source** relation on the through model is inferred by singularizing
  the relation name (`"teams"` → `"team"`); override with `source:`. Both
  `belongs_to` sources (join-model shape above) and `has_many` sources
  (distant children: `has_many "comments", through: "posts"`) work.
- A **soft-deleting through model** automatically excludes soft-deleted join
  rows.
- Resolution happens lazily at first access (the through model may be defined
  later); a missing through or source relation raises naming exactly what was
  searched and suggesting `source:`.
- **Pushing creates the join record**: `user.teams << team` (or `<< key`)
  inserts a row in the through collection, HABTM-style — a raw join-row write
  (the through model's validations and callbacks are skipped; its counter
  caches are bumped). Only `belongs_to` sources are writable; a
  `has_many`-source push raises with a pointer at creating the child
  directly, and an unpersisted owner raises.
- **Bulk writes and eager-loading stay off**: `delete_all`/`update_all` on a
  through association raise (they would hit *target* rows, not join rows —
  operate on the through relation's records instead), and eager-loading
  (`includes`, `join`, `includes_count`) of a through relation raises.

### Counter Caches

`belongs_to ..., counter_cache:` keeps a children count on the parent row up
to date, so lists render without a COUNT query per row:

```soli
class Comment < Model
  belongs_to "post", counter_cache: true            # maintains posts.comments_count
  belongs_to("author", {"class_name": "User", "counter_cache": "authored_count"})
end

post.comments_count                    # plain field read (0/missing until first bump)
Post.reset_counters(post._key, "comments")  # recount → write → returns Int
```

Semantics:

- `counter_cache: true` derives the column from the child collection
  (`comments` → `comments_count`); a string picks a custom column. The parent
  needs no schema preparation — a missing column reads as 0.
- Bumps ride the same atomic path as `increment`/`decrement` — an If-Match CAS
  loop on SoliDB, a single arithmetic `UPDATE` on the SQL adapters — and fire on
  child `create`/`save`, hard `delete` (instance and class form),
  FK reassignment on `update`/`save`/`Model.update(id, ...)` (−1 old parent,
  +1 new), and — for soft-deleting children — soft `delete` (−1) and
  `restore` (+1), so counters track default-scope-visible children.
- **Bulk writes never bump** (`delete_all`, `update_all`, `upsert`, `import`,
  `prune`) and bumps are **best-effort**: a failing bump never fails the
  already-committed primary write. Counters are eventually consistent under
  failures — `Model.reset_counters(id, relation)` is the repair tool (it
  recounts minus soft-deleted children and returns the fresh count).

### Polymorphic Relations

A polymorphic `belongs_to` lets one model belong to any of several others on
a single association — comments on posts *and* photos, images on anything:

```soli
class Comment < Model
  belongs_to "commentable", polymorphic: true
end

class Post < Model
  has_many "comments", as: "commentable"
end

class Photo < Model
  has_many "comments", as: "commentable"
end

# The child stores both halves of the reference:
Comment.create({
  "body": "Nice shot!",
  "commentable_id": photo._key,
  "commentable_type": "Photo"
})

comment.commentable    # → the Photo instance (class resolved from commentable_type)
post.comments          # → chainable QB, type-guarded: commentable_type == "Post"
```

Semantics:

- The child stores `{name}_id` **and** `{name}_type` (the model class name).
  The accessor reads both at runtime, resolves the class and collection from
  the type string, and returns the correctly-typed instance — `null` when
  either field is missing, an error naming the type when it doesn't match a
  known model class.
- The `as:` inverse is a normal `has_many`/`has_one` whose every query —
  accessor, `includes`, `includes_count`, `join`, cascades — carries the
  `{as}_type == "<OwnerClass>"` guard, so two parents with colliding keys
  never see each other's children.
- **Association writers auto-set both fields**: `customer.comments <<
  Comment.create({...})` and `customer.comments.create({...})` stamp
  `commentable_id` *and* `commentable_type` — see
  [Writing through associations](#writing-through-associations).
- **`counter_cache:` works** on a polymorphic belongs_to: the parent
  collection is resolved from the type at bump time, so each parent type
  maintains its own count, and a reassignment across *types* moves the count
  between collections. `reset_counters` recounts with the type guard.
- **`dependent:` works** on `as:` relations — only the owner's typed
  children cascade; `"nullify"` clears both the FK **and** the type field.
- **Eager-loading a polymorphic belongs_to raises** (`includes`/`join` — the
  target collection varies per row, which doesn't fit one query; Rails has
  the same restriction). Access `record.commentable` directly. The `as:`
  inverse eager-loads normally.
- `polymorphic: true` combined with `class_name:` raises at class load (the
  target type comes from the record, not the declaration).

### Single-Collection Inheritance (STI)

A model inheriting from another model shares its base's collection, with a
`type` discriminator — Rails single-table inheritance, per-collection:

```soli
class User < Model
  validates("email", {"presence": true})
  has_many "posts"
  scope("recent", fn() { this.order("_created_at", "desc") })
end

class Admin < User
  def badge
    "admin"
  end
end

Admin.create({"email": "a@x.co"})   # stored in `users` with type: "Admin"
User.all()                           # every row — admins hydrate AS Admin
Admin.all()                          # only Admin rows (and Admin's descendants)
User.find(admin._key).badge()        # "admin" — hydration follows the type
```

On a column-aware model the same rules apply to a real `type` column:

```soli
class User < Model
  table "users"          # must include a string `type` column
end

class Admin < User
end

Admin.create({ "email": "a@x.co" })   # INSERT … type = 'Admin'
Admin.where({ "email": "a@x.co" })    # AND type IN ('Admin', …descendants)
User.find(admin.id).type              # "Admin"
```

Boot fails if an STI subclass's table has no `type` column. `find` / `find_by`
/ `first_by` on a subclass refuse a row of another type (`RecordNotFound` /
`nil`), matching the document path.

Semantics:

- **Subclass writes stamp `type`** (`create`, `save`, `find_or_create_by`);
  rows **hydrate as their stored type** everywhere (`find`, `where`, `all`,
  relation accessors) — a guard ignores a `type` value that doesn't name a
  model class belonging to the row's collection, so unrelated data fields
  called `type` can't hijack hydration.
- **Subclass queries are type-scoped** — `Admin.where/all/count/find_by/
  first_by/delete_all` and every chained QueryBuilder filter
  `type IN ["Admin", ...descendants]`. The **base class matches every row**
  (no filter), Rails-style. `Admin.find(user_key)` on a base-class row raises
  `RecordNotFound`, and class-form `update(id)`/`delete(id)` refuse rows
  outside the hierarchy.
- **Metadata copies down at class definition**: validations, callbacks (named
  and closure), relations (with the base's foreign key, e.g. `user_id`),
  scopes, soft-delete, `attr_accessible`, `encrypts`, enums, and state
  machines all apply to subclasses; the subclass's own declarations run after
  the copy and append/override. Declare the parent before its subclasses
  (file order already guarantees this) — parent DSL added *after* a subclass
  is defined does not propagate.
- The discriminator column is always `type`; avoid a user field of that name
  on STI hierarchies.

### Manual Relationships

You can also implement relationships as custom methods for more control:

```soli
class Post < Model
  def author()
    User.find(this.author_id)
  end
end
```

## Graph Models (Edges and Traversal)

SoliDB is multi-model: alongside document collections it supports native
**edge collections**. Declare an edge model with the `edge` DSL and the Model
API gains graph creation, traversal, and shortest-path queries:

```soli
class Follow < Model
  edge from: "users", to: "users"
end
```

`from:` and `to:` accept collection names (`"users"`) or model class names
(`"User"`). The declaration marks the collection as the SolidB `edge` type —
in dev it is auto-created with that type plus hash indexes on `_from` and
`_to`.

### Creating Edges

Endpoints can be model instances, full `"collection/key"` ids, or bare keys:

```soli
f = Follow.create(from: alice, to: bob)
f = Follow.create({ "from": alice, "to": "users/bob-key", "since": 2024 })

f._from   # => "users/alice-key"
f._to     # => "users/bob-key"
```

Edges are ordinary model records — validations, callbacks, and extra
attributes (`since` above) work as usual. A missing or invalid endpoint
behaves like a failed validation: `f._errors` is set (e.g.
`[{ "field": "from", "message": "..." }]`) and the edge is not persisted.

### Traversal

Call `.traverse(EdgeModel, options?)` on a **saved** record to get a chainable
QueryBuilder over the reachable vertices:

```soli
friends   = alice.traverse(Follow).all                    # OUTBOUND, depth 1..1
followers = alice.traverse(Follow, direction: "in").all   # INBOUND
network   = alice.traverse(Follow, depth: 3).all          # depth 1..3

# Full chain — vertex filters use the usual `doc` variable; prefix a filter
# with `edge.` to match edge attributes instead:
ring = alice.traverse(Follow, depth: [2, 3], direction: "any")
  .where({ "active": true })
  .where("edge.since >= @y", { "y": 2024 })
  .order("name")
  .limit(10)
  .all

n = alice.traverse(Follow).count
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `direction` | `"out"` | `"out"` (OUTBOUND), `"in"` (INBOUND), or `"any"` |
| `depth` | `1` | Int `n` traverses depth `1..n`; a `[min, max]` array sets an explicit range |

> **Depth gotcha:** Soli's `1..3` range literal materializes to the
> exclusive-end array `[1, 2]`. Prefer an explicit `[1, 3]` array for depth
> ranges.

- Results are instances of the target model — the class is resolved per
  document, so mixed-vertex graphs return the right class for each vertex.
- Soft-delete models compose: the deleted-filter is applied to the vertices.
- A traversal builder does **not** compose with `includes`, `includes_count`,
  `join`, `group_by`, `update_all`, or `delete_all` — combining them raises a
  clear error. **`.similar()` does compose** — rank traversal results by
  semantic relevance (exact client-side cosine; no HNSW pushdown on graph
  queries).
- `Model.graph_rag(query, options)` — graph-augmented retrieval: ANN seeds,
  expand through an edge model, re-rank. See [Graph RAG](#graph-rag) below.
- `traverse` and `shortest_path` require a saved record (they raise
  otherwise).

### Shortest Path

`shortest_path` executes immediately (no `.all`) and returns the vertices
along the shortest path between two records — `[]` when they are not
connected. Direction defaults to `"any"`:

```soli
path = alice.shortest_path(bob, via: Follow)
path = alice.shortest_path("users/bob-key", via: Follow, direction: "out")
```

### Relation Sugar

An idiomatic named relation over a traversal is just a plain method:

```soli
class User < Model
  def followers()
    this.traverse(Follow, { "direction": "in" })
  end
end

User.find(key).followers().where({ "active": true }).count
```

### Migrations

Dev auto-create already provisions the edge type and the `_from`/`_to` hash
indexes. For explicit production migrations:

```soli
def up(db: Any)
  db.create_collection("follows", "edge")
  db.create_index("follows", "idx_follows_from", ["_from"], {})
  db.create_index("follows", "idx_follows_to", ["_to"], {})
end
```

### Graph RAG

Combine **vector retrieval** with **graph expansion** for richer RAG context.
Two APIs:

**Composition** — rank neighbors of a seed vertex by meaning:

```soli
# Saved record required for traverse()
related = product.traverse(CompatibleWith, depth: 1)
  .similar("wireless accessories", "embedding", 5)
  .all

for item in related
  print(item.name + " — " + str(item._similarity_score))
end
```

Traversal + `.similar()` always uses exact client-side cosine over the
reachable vertices (HNSW pushdown does not apply to graph FOR-heads).

**`Model.graph_rag()`** — seed-and-expand in one eager call:

```soli
class CompatibleWith < Model
  edge from: "products", to: "products"
end

class Product < Model
  vector_index "embedding", dimension: 1536, metric: "cosine"

  before_save fn() {
    this.embedding = embed(this.name + ". " + this.description)
  }
end

context = Product.graph_rag("running headphones with long battery", {
  "via": CompatibleWith,
  "direction": "any",
  "depth": 1,
  "seed_k": 3,
  "limit": 8
})

for product in context
  print(product.name)
  print("  score: " + str(product._similarity_score))
  print("  seed:  " + str(product._graph_seed))
  print("  hops:  " + str(product._graph_hops))
end

answer = llm_generate(
  "Recommend only from the list. Mention names and prices.",
  build_product_context(context) + "\n\nQuestion: running headphones"
)
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `via` | — | **Required.** Edge model class (must declare `edge from:, to:`) |
| `direction` | `"out"` | `"out"`, `"in"`, or `"any"` |
| `depth` | `1` | Int `n` (1..n) or `[min, max]` array |
| `field` | `"embedding"` | Vector field covered by `vector_index` |
| `seed_k` | `5` | ANN seeds from the collection index |
| `limit` | `10` | Final result cap after expand + re-rank |
| `vector` | — | Query vector literal — skips the embedding API call |

Each result carries `_similarity_score` (re-rank score), `_graph_seed` (true
for direct ANN hits), and `_graph_hops` (0 for seeds, 1 for expanded
neighbors in v1).

## Finder Methods

Find records by specific field values:

```soli
# Find by exact field match
user = User.find_by("email", "alice@example.com");

# Find with ordering (first by field value)
user = User.first_by("name", "Alice");

# Find or create - returns existing or creates new
user = User.find_or_create_by("email", "new@example.com");
user = User.find_or_create_by("email", "new@example.com", { "name": "New User" });
```

### Dynamic Finder Methods

Automatically generated finders for any field combination:

```soli
# Single field finder
user = User.find_by_email("alice@example.com");

# Two-field finder (AND logic)
user = User.find_by_email_and_active("alice@example.com", true);

# Three+ field combinations
post = Post.find_by_title_and_published_and_author_id("Hello", true, 123);
```

These methods return the first matching record or `null` if not found.

## Aggregations

Calculate sums, averages, min, max on query results:

```soli
# Sum
total = User.where("age > @a", { "a": 18 }).sum("balance");

# Average
avg = User.avg("score");

# Minimum
min_score = User.min("score");

# Maximum
max_score = User.max("views");

# Group by aggregation (legacy 3-arg form, unchanged)
by_country = User.group_by("country", "sum", "balance");
# Returns: [{ group: "US", result: 1000 }, { group: "FR", result: 500 }, ...]
```

### Rich grouped aggregation

The newer form groups on one or more fields and computes several named
aggregates at once, with `having` for post-group filtering:

```soli
rows = Order
  .where({ "status": "paid" })
  .group_by(["country", "plan"])
  .aggregate({ "total": ["sum", "amount"], "n": ["count"] })
  .having("total > @min", { "min": 1000 })
  .order("total", "desc")
  .all
# => [{ "country": "FR", "plan": "pro", "total": 5300, "n": 12 }, ...]

User.group_by("role").all           # 1-arg form: implicit count per group ("n")
Order.aggregate({ "n": ["count"] }).first   # ungrouped: one row
Order.median("amount").first        # also: stddev / variance / count_distinct
```

Aggregate functions: `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `count_distinct`,
`median`, `stddev`, `variance` (no `PERCENTILE` — SolidB has no such
function). The full treatment — `having` security notes, soft-delete
behavior, the window-function escape hatch — lives in
[Analytics & Columnar Stores](analytics.md).

## Pluck and Exists

Quick queries for specific data:

```soli
# Get array of single field values
names = User.where("active = @a", { "a": true }).pluck("name");
# Returns: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# Get multiple fields as hashes — self-describing, and the projection runs
# in the database: only the named fields travel over the wire
users = User.pluck("name", "email");
# Returns: [{ name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" }, ...]

# Symbols work wherever a field name is expected — same query, Rails-style
users = User.pluck(:name, :email).all
posts = Post.order(:created_at, :desc).limit(10).all

# Check if records exist (returns boolean)
exists = User.where("role = @r", { "r": "admin" }).exists;
# Returns: true or false
```

## Vector / Similarity Search

Rank results by semantic relevance using `.similar()`:

```soli
# Basic semantic search (uses default "embedding" field, top 10)
results = Post
    .where("published == true")
    .similar("how to deploy a web app")
    .all

# Custom embedding field and result count
results = Product
    .where("active == true")
    .similar("red running shoes", "title_embedding", 5)
    .all

# Each result gets a _similarity_score
for product in results
    print(product.name + " (" + str(product._similarity_score) + ")")
end
```

Requires `SOLI_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` environment variable. See [database docs](/docs/database/finders#similar-simple) for configuration.

### Index pushdown (`vector_index`)

Declare a `vector_index` on the embedding field and `.similar()` pushes the
search down to the database's HNSW index (approximate nearest neighbor)
instead of computing cosine similarity client-side:

```soli
class Article < Model
  vector_index "embedding", dimension: 1536, metric: "cosine"
end

Article.similar("query text", "embedding", 5)          # ANN via the HNSW index
Article.similar([0.1, 0.2, ...], "embedding", 5)       # vector literal — no embedding call
Article.similar("q", "embedding", 5, { "exact": true })  # force exact client-side cosine
```

ANN results are approximate, and chained `where` filters are applied *after*
candidate selection (4×k candidates, capped at 400) — so fewer than `k` rows
may return. Without a `vector_index` declaration, `.similar()` keeps the
historical client-side path, unchanged. Full details, plus **fulltext**
(`Model.search`, `_search_score`) and **geo** (`near` / `within`,
`_distance`) search and the index DSL, live in
[Search: Vector, Fulltext & Geo](search.md).

## Instance Methods

Methods available on model instances:

```soli
user = User.find("user_id");

# Update fields and persist
user.name = "New Name";
user.update();

# Atomic increment/decrement (CAS via `_rev` on SoliDB; one UPDATE on SQL)
user.increment("view_count");      # +1
user.increment("view_count", 5);   # +5
user.decrement("stock");           # -1

# Update timestamp only
user.touch();  # Updates _updated_at

# Refresh from database
user.reload();
```

### Dirty tracking

Model instances track which attributes changed since they were loaded from
(or last persisted to) the database:

```soli
user = User.find(id)
user.changed?                 # false — freshly loaded
user.name = "New Name"

user.changed?                 # true
user.changed                  # ["name"]  (sorted attribute names)
user.changes                  # { "name": ["Old Name", "New Name"] }
user.attribute_was("name")    # "Old Name"

user.save()
user.changed?                 # false — baseline reset
user.previous_changes         # { "name": ["Old Name", "New Name"] }
```

Semantics worth knowing:

- **New records report every attribute as changed** — `User.new({"name": "A"})`
  has `changes == { "name": [null, "A"] }`, and after `create` the record's
  `previous_changes` covers all inserted attributes (including `id`), matching
  Rails.
- **Failed persists keep the record dirty.** A validation or DB error on
  `save`/`update` leaves `changed?` true and `previous_changes` untouched.
- `reload()` resets the baseline and clears `previous_changes`; atomic
  `increment`/`decrement`, soft `delete()`, and `restore()` keep their written
  field clean.
- **Tracking is value-based.** Reassigning an attribute to an equal value is
  not a change. Conversely, mutating a nested Hash/Array *in place*
  (`user.tags.push("x")`) is invisible to tracking — reassign the attribute
  (`user.tags = updated_tags`) to record it.
- There are no dynamic per-attribute methods (`name_was`); use
  `attribute_was("name")`. A database column literally named `changed`
  shadows the method (field reads win), like any other field/method collision.

### How `increment` / `decrement` stay atomic under concurrency

`increment` and `decrement` are **not** plain read-modify-writes on the in-memory
instance. How atomicity is achieved depends on the backend:

- **SoliDB** drives an optimistic compare-and-swap loop (below).
- **Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite** do the arithmetic **inside one `UPDATE`**
  (`jsonb_set` / `JSON_SET` / `json_set` over the current value), so the row's own
  lock serializes concurrent bumps. There is no retry loop and no contention
  error on these adapters — and no `_rev`, which SQL document tables do not have.
  A column-aware model increments the real column the same way
  (`SET col = COALESCE(col, 0) + ?`), and a non-numeric column is refused by name.
  A missing field (or a `NULL` column) counts as 0, so nothing needs backfilling.

On SoliDB each call:

1. Re-fetch the document to read the current field value and its `_rev`.
2. Compute `current + delta` (or `current - delta`).
3. PUT the new value with an `If-Match: <rev>` header.
4. If another writer modified the document in between, the DB returns
   `409 Conflict` and the loop retries (up to 10 attempts) by re-fetching.

On success the in-memory instance's field **and** `_rev` are refreshed, so any
follow-up call observes the same state the DB now holds. Concurrent
increments cannot lose updates: every successful PUT was the unique
continuation of the rev it read.

If the document is being hit by many writers at once, `increment` may return
an error like `"increment failed: Atomic update of users.view_count failed
after 10 attempts (too much contention)"` instead of silently dropping the
update. Callers can retry, queue the work, or back off as they prefer.

### Bulk attribute updates: `.save(hash)` and `.update(hash)`

Both `.save()` and `.update()` accept an optional hash of attributes that are
applied to the instance before the persist pipeline runs. This collapses the
common "set multiple fields, then save" pattern into a single call:

```soli
# Instead of:
user.name = "Alice";
user.email = "alice@example.com";
user.role = "admin";
user.save();

# Write:
user.save({
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
});
```

The hash is merged onto the instance — keys you don't pass keep their current
value, keys you do pass overwrite. Validations run *after* the merge, so
errors surface on `.errors` the same way as individual field assignments:

```soli
# Partial update — only `price` changes, `name` is preserved
p = Product.find(id);
p.update({ "price": 99.00 });

# Mix field assignment with hash — pre-assigned fields fall back when hash
# omits them, hash wins on conflict.
p = Product.new();
p.name = "Widget";            # will survive
p.save({ "price": 12.50 });   # name stays "Widget", price becomes 12.50
```

Framework-internal fields (`_key`, `_id`, `_rev`, `_errors`, etc.) are
silently skipped when they appear in the hash — you can't overwrite them via
bulk update. A non-hash argument raises:
`expected a Hash of attributes, got <type>`.

`.update(hash)` is effectively sugar for `.save(hash)` on an existing record
(requires `_key` to be set); the two share the exact same validation and DB
write path.

## Scopes

Define reusable query scopes. Inside the closure `this` is bound to a fresh `QueryBuilder` for the model; the closure returns a (possibly refined) `QueryBuilder`. Accessing the scope name on the class invokes the closure:

```soli
class User < Model
  scope("active", fn() { this.where("active = @a", { "a": true }) })
  scope("recent", fn() { this.order("created_at", "desc").limit(10) })
end

# Use scopes — `User.active` invokes the closure and returns a QueryBuilder
# you can chain further:
let active_users = User.active.all
let top_ten     = User.recent.where("verified = @v", { "v": true }).all
```

Scopes compose: `User.active.recent` chains both closures' refinements. See [Metaprogramming](metaprogramming.md#named-scopes) for the underlying mechanism.

## Soft Delete

Mark records as deleted without removing them:

```soli
class Post < Model
  soft_delete
end

# Delete sets deleted_at timestamp
post.delete();

# Restore clears deleted_at
post.restore();

# Query without deleted records (default behavior)
posts = Post.all;

# Include soft-deleted records
all = Post.with_deleted.all;

# Query only deleted records
deleted = Post.only_deleted.all;
```

Interactions with other features: a soft `delete()` **does not run
[`dependent:` cascades](#cascade-deletes)** (children survive, so `restore()`
has nothing to un-do), and it keeps dirty tracking clean for `deleted_at`. A
soft-deleting child with a [`counter_cache:`](#counter-caches) decrements its
parent's counter, and `restore()` increments it back.

## Timeseries Models

Declare a model as timeseries with the `timeseries` DSL. The collection is
created with the SolidB `timeseries` type — optimized for append-only,
time-indexed data (metrics, logs, telemetry):

```soli
class Metric < Model
  timeseries retention: "30d"     # bare `timeseries` (no options) also works
end

class Reading < Model
  timeseries retention: "90d", timestamp: "recorded_at"
end
```

- `retention:` — optional retention window; used by `prune` when called
  without an argument.
- `timestamp:` — the field `time_bucket` buckets on. Defaults to the
  server-set `_created_at`.

### Insert-Only

Timeseries records are insert-only, mirroring the database's own rules.
Documents get UUIDv7 keys, so `_key` order is insertion-time order:

```soli
Metric.create({ "device": "srv1", "value": 0.42 })

m.update({ "value": 1 })
# => raises: "Metric is a timeseries model: records are insert-only.
#    update is not supported — use prune() for retention."
```

Blocked: static `update` / `upsert`, instance `update` / `save` on an
existing record / `increment` / `decrement`, and `update_all`. Allowed:
`delete` and `delete_all`.

> Don't set `_key` yourself on a timeseries model. `prune` relies on the
> UUIDv7 key ordering — documents inserted with a caller-supplied `_key` are
> never pruned.

### Bucketed Aggregation (`time_bucket`)

`time_bucket(interval, aggregates?)` groups rows into fixed time buckets and
computes per-bucket aggregates. Chain it after `where(...)` filters and
finish with `.all`:

```soli
rows = Metric.where("device = @d", { "d": "srv1" })
  .time_bucket("5m", { "avg": "value", "max": "value" })
  .all
# => [{ "bucket": "2026-07-05T10:00:00+00:00", "avg": 0.41, "max": 0.9 }, ...]

rows = Metric.time_bucket("1d").all                  # bare form: count per bucket
# => [{ "bucket": "...", "count": 42 }, ...]

rows = Metric.time_bucket("1h", avg: "value").all    # keyword style works too
```

- Interval units: `s`, `m`, `h`, `d` (the database's `TIME_BUCKET` contract).
- Aggregates: `sum` / `avg` / `min` / `max` take a field name; `count` takes
  `true` (`{ "count": true }`). With no aggregates you get a `count` per
  bucket.
- Buckets fall on the declared `timestamp:` field (default `_created_at`).
- Rows come back as plain hashes — `bucket` (an RFC3339 string) plus your
  aggregate aliases — sorted by bucket.

### Retention (`prune`)

`prune` deletes rows older than a cutoff and returns the number deleted:

```soli
deleted = Metric.prune("30d")                    # duration cutoff (units: s/m/h/d/w)
deleted = Metric.prune("2026-06-01T00:00:00Z")   # explicit RFC3339 cutoff
deleted = Metric.prune                           # uses the declared retention:
```

There is no auto-prune scheduler. Register a recurring [cron job](jobs.md)
whose handler calls `prune`:

```soli
Cron.schedule("prune_metrics", Cron.daily_at("03:00"), "PruneMetricsJob", {})
# ...and PruneMetricsJob.perform is a one-liner: Metric.prune
```

### Migrations and Continuous Aggregates

Dev auto-create provisions the `timeseries` type for you; the explicit
migration form is:

```soli
def up(db: Any)
  db.create_collection("metrics", "timeseries")
end
```

`db.prune_collection("metrics", "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z")` is also available on
the migration `db` handle for one-off cleanups. For continuous aggregates
(downsampling on write), SolidB streams are the raw-SDBQL escape hatch —
`db.query("CREATE STREAM ...")` in a migration. See
[Migrations](migrations.md).

## Encrypted Attributes

Encrypt sensitive fields at rest with `encrypts`. Values are encrypted on
create/save/update and decrypted transparently on load, using AES-256-GCM:

```soli
class User < Model
  encrypts(:ssn, :api_token)
end

u = User.create({ "ssn": "123-45-6789", "email": "a@b.com" });
# stored ciphertext in the DB; in memory it's plaintext:
User.find(u._key).ssn  # => "123-45-6789"
```

Works on SoliDB document collections, SQL document tables (`_key` + `doc`),
and column-aware models:

```soli
class User < Model
  table "users"          # `ssn` must be a string/text column
  encrypts(:ssn)
end
```

Ciphertext is stored in that column; `create` / `save` / `find` decrypt so
the instance always sees plaintext. Boot fails if the column is missing or
not text (encrypted values are base64).

The encryption key comes from the `SOLI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable —
set it to a long, high-entropy secret (e.g. `Crypto.random_hex(32)`) and keep
it out of source control.

> **Encrypted columns can't be queried by value.** AES-GCM uses a random nonce,
> so the same plaintext encrypts to different ciphertext every time —
> `User.where("ssn = @s", { "s": "123-45-6789" })` will never match. Encrypt
> only fields you store and read, not ones you filter on.

A field written before `encrypts` was added (legacy plaintext) is returned
as-is on load rather than erroring. Low-level/transaction writes that bypass
`create`/`save` aren't auto-encrypted — use `Crypto.encrypt` directly there.

`encrypts` builds on the standalone `Crypto.encrypt(plaintext, key?)` /
`Crypto.decrypt(ciphertext, key?)` builtins, which you can also use on their
own (key defaults to `SOLI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`).

## Relationship Accessors

Access related records directly from instances:

```soli
user = User.find("user_id");

# has_many returns a chainable QueryBuilder, not an array.
# Each terminal call (.all, .count, .delete_all, iteration, ...)
# runs a query against the foreign-key filter at that moment.
posts = user.posts;

# Access has_one relation
profile = user.profile;

# Access belongs_to relation
author = post.user;
```

### Writing through associations

`has_many` accessors (including polymorphic `as:` inverses) accept writes —
the foreign key, and the polymorphic type when applicable, are stamped
automatically:

```soli
# Create a child through the relation — FK (and type) auto-set:
post = author.posts.create({"title": "seeded"})
post._errors                # null on success, error array on validation failure

# Adopt an existing (or unpersisted) record — sets the FK and saves:
author.posts << loose_post
author.posts << [draft_a, draft_b]

# Polymorphic inverses stamp both halves of the reference:
customer.comments << Comment.create({"message": "bla"})
comment = customer.comments.create({"message": "bla"})
comment.commentable_id      # customer._key
comment.commentable_type    # "Customer"
```

Semantics:

- Both writers persist through the **regular save path** — validations,
  `before_/after_save`/`create`/`update` callbacks, counter caches, and dirty
  tracking all apply. `.create` returns the instance (`_errors` carries
  validation failures, like `Model.create`); a failing `<<` raises so the
  push can't silently no-op.
- The association seed **wins over caller-supplied values** — passing a
  different `commentable_id` to `customer.comments.create` is overridden.
- The owner must be persisted (`<<`/`.create` on an unpersisted owner
  raises); `<<` expects model instances (or an array of them), not raw keys.
- On HABTM relations `<<` inserts a join row, and on `through:` relations it
  creates the join record — both documented in their sections. `.create` on
  a `through:` relation raises (create the record and push it instead).

### has_many is Enumerable AND chainable

The `has_many` accessor behaves like an array (iteration, indexing, `len`,
`each`, `map`, `filter`, ...) **and** like a QueryBuilder
(`.where`, `.order`, `.limit`, `.count`, `.delete_all`, `.exists`, ...):

```soli
user = User.find("user_id");

# Iterate — each iteration runs the FK-filtered query once
for post in user.posts
  print(post.title);
end

# Indexing materializes the result set
first = user.posts[0];

# len() and .length / .size return the count
n = len(user.posts);
same = user.posts.length;
alt = user.posts.size;

# Array-style helpers materialize then delegate
user.posts.each(fn(p) { print(p.title) });
titles = user.posts.map(fn(p) { p.title });

# Chained query — composes onto the seed `user_id == @__rel_fk` filter
published = user.posts.where("published = @p", { "p": true }).all;
n_pub = user.posts.where("published = @p", { "p": true }).count;

# Bulk delete — one REMOVE statement, no N+1
user.posts.delete_all;
user.posts.where("draft = @d", { "d": true }).delete_all;

# Bulk update — one UPDATE statement, no N+1
user.posts.where("draft = @d", { "d": true }).update_all({ "draft": false });

# Sort / paginate before materializing
recent = user.posts.order("created_at", "desc").limit(10).all;
```

Notes:

- An owner that has not been saved yet (no `_key`) returns a QueryBuilder
  whose filter never matches — `count` is `0`, `delete_all` / `update_all`
  are no-ops, and iteration yields nothing.
- If the related model uses `soft_delete`, soft-deleted children are filtered
  out of the relation (consistent with `Related.where(...)`). Use the static
  `Related.with_deleted` / `Related.only_deleted` to query them explicitly.
- `belongs_to` and `has_one` still return a single instance (or `nil`),
  not a QueryBuilder.

## Batch Operations

Insert or update multiple records:

```soli
# Batch create
result = User.create_many([
  { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" },
  { "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com" },
  { "name": "Charlie", "email": "charlie@example.com" }
]);
# Returns: { "created": 3, "errors": [] }

# Upsert (insert or update by ID)
User.upsert("user123", { "name": "Updated Name" });
# Updates if exists, inserts with ID if not

# Batch delete via QueryBuilder — one AQL REMOVE for the whole match.
# Useful for clearing a relation without an N+1 loop:
User.where("doc.active == false").delete_all;
post.comments.delete_all;          # via has_many relation
Model.delete_all;                  # static — wipe the whole collection

# Batch update via QueryBuilder — one AQL UPDATE for the whole match.
# Patches every matching row; skips validations and callbacks:
User.where("doc.active == false").update_all({ "archived": true });
post.comments.where("draft = @d", { "d": true }).update_all({ "draft": false });
```

### Batch Iteration (`find_each` / `in_batches`)

The operations above are bulk *writes*. On the read side, `.all` materialises
every matching row as Soli values at once, so a job over a large collection is
bounded by RAM rather than by anything you chose. `.each` is not an escape
hatch — it materialises first, then iterates.

`find_each` walks the whole result set one record at a time, holding only one
batch in memory:

```soli
# One batch of 1000 in memory at a time, however large the collection is.
User.find_each(fn(user) {
  user.recompute_score();
});

# Any filter chain composes.
User.where("doc.active == true").find_each(fn(user) {
  user.backfill_initials();
}, { "batch_size": 500 });
```

`in_batches` (alias `find_in_batches`) hands the block each batch as an array,
which is what you want when the work itself is bulk:

```soli
Invoice.where("doc.status == @s", { "s": "pending" }).in_batches(fn(batch) {
  Mailer.deliver_reminders(batch);
}, { "batch_size": 200 });
```

`batch_size` defaults to 1000 and is capped at 10,000 — past that the batch is
large enough to be the memory problem it exists to avoid.

**Paging is by key, not by offset.** Each batch adds
`FILTER doc._key > <last key of the previous batch>` and sorts by `_key`
ascending. `LIMIT offset, n` would degrade as the offset grows and — worse —
skip or repeat rows when the collection is written to mid-scan, which is exactly
what a long correction job does to the collection it is correcting. Deleting or
updating records inside the block is therefore safe: the cursor is read before
the block runs.

Because the ordering is fixed and the batch size is the limit, these are
**refused** rather than silently ignored:

| Rejected | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `.order(...)` | Batches are ordered by `_key` so the cursor advances |
| `.limit(...)` | The batch size *is* the limit |
| `.offset(...)` | Batches are positioned by key, not by offset |
| `.pluck(...)` | Projected rows carry no `_key` to position the next batch |
| aggregates, `.group_by`, `.time_bucket`, `.exists` | They return a value or reshaped rows, not records |
| `.similar(...)` | Results are ordered by score, which key ordering would override |
| inside `grouped(...)` | Each batch needs the previous batch's rows to build the next query, so the reads cannot be coalesced |

A columnar model has no `_key`, so it has no batch iteration either — use the
columnar `query` / `aggregate` surface instead.

Both spellings work from the class and from a chain: `User.find_each(...)` and
`User.where(...).find_each(...)` are the same code path. Both return `null`;
they are traversals, not projections.

## Coalescing Reads (`grouped`)

A controller action that reads several unrelated things pays one network
round-trip per read:

```soli
@posts    = Post.all                          # round-trip 1
@accounts = Account.where({ active: true }).count   # round-trip 2
@tags     = Tag.all                           # round-trip 3
```

Wrap the reads in `grouped(fn() { ... })` and they are deferred and combined
into a **single** request — one `LET … RETURN […]` statement that computes every
subquery server-side and returns them together:

```soli
grouped(fn() {
  @posts    = Post.all
  @accounts = Account.where({ active: true }).count
  @tags     = Tag.all
})
# one round-trip for all three
```

Inside the block each read returns a placeholder instead of hitting the
database; the queries fire as one combined statement when the block ends, and the
results are then materialised. **After** the block you use `@posts`,
`@accounts`, and `@tags` exactly as before — iterate them, index them, read
fields, serialise them to JSON.

Strictly speaking the binding stays a thin placeholder that resolves to its value
on use, rather than being replaced by one. That is invisible in normal code, but
it is why a *new* way of consuming a value can occasionally need teaching to
unwrap it — if you ever see an error naming a type that the value plainly is
(`cannot iterate over array`), that is the shape of the bug, and it is worth
reporting.

### What gets coalesced

Read queries are batched: `all`, `where(...).all` / `.first` / `.count` /
`.exists`, the aggregates (`sum` / `avg` / `min` / `max`), `find`, `find_by`, and
`first_by`. **Writes are not** — `create`, `save`, `update`, `delete` run
immediately even inside the block (use `transaction` for atomic writes).

### Reading a result inside the block (auto-flush)

If you read one of the deferred results *before* the block ends, the queries
collected so far fire immediately (an "auto-flush"), then collection resumes for
the rest:

```soli
grouped(fn() {
  @posts = Post.all
  log("loaded #{@posts.length} posts") if @posts.present?  # forces a flush here
  @tags = Tag.all                                          # batched separately
})
```

This always returns correct data; it just means you get more than one round-trip
when you interleave reads. For maximum coalescing, do the reads first and use the
results after the block.

### Notes

- `find` on a missing id still raises `RecordNotFound` (→ 404) — the error
  surfaces when the result is read or the block ends.
- A combined query is all-or-nothing: if it fails, every read in the batch
  fails together.
- In interactive **`--dev`** the reads are *not* coalesced — each runs as its own
  query so the dev query log stays readable (you see the natural statements
  instead of one combined `LET … RETURN […]`). Coalescing is active in
  production, where the single round-trip is what matters.
- **`soli test` coalesces.** The test server runs with `--dev` so the query log
  is populated, but specs exercise the *production* shape deliberately —
  otherwise the whole coalescing path would go untested and `assert_query_count`
  would measure dev's un-coalesced number instead of the round-trips production
  makes. A grouped action reports **one** query in a spec, not one per read.

### Finding reads that should be grouped

Because `grouped` is for reads that each run *once*, an N+1 scan can never point
you at them: it fingerprints by query template and only fires on a *repeated*
one. Three unrelated reads are three distinct templates with a count of one
each — invisible to `assert_no_n_plus_one` and to the dev bar's N+1 badge.

Two tools cover that blind spot:

- The **dev bar** query panel shows a `N READS · N ROUND-TRIPS` advisory when a
  request issues three or more distinct one-off reads outside any `grouped`
  block. It is amber, not red: it is a suggestion, because reads that feed each
  other cannot share a round-trip.
- **`assert_no_ungrouped_reads(response)`** fails a spec on the same condition:

  ```soli
  test("the dashboard loads in one round-trip", fn() {
    let response = get("/dashboard")
    assert_no_ungrouped_reads(response)
    assert_query_count(response, 1)
  })
  ```

Neither can prove the reads are independent — `User.find(id)` followed by a query
on `user._key` is genuinely two round-trips. When the reads must be sequential,
that advisory is a false positive and the assertion is the wrong tool for that
action.

## Transactions

Execute multiple operations atomically within a database transaction:

### Using a Block (Recommended)

`Model.transaction` runs a block inside a single database transaction. Every
document write inside the block — `create`, `save`, `update`, `delete`, and key
lookups via `find` — participates automatically. The block **commits** when it
returns normally and **rolls back** (re-raising the error) if it throws:

```soli
User.transaction do
  User.create({ "name": "Alice", "age": 30 })
  User.create({ "name": "Bob", "age": 25 })
end
# Both rows commit together. If either operation — or your own `throw` —
# raises, neither row is persisted.
```

The block's value is returned, so you can hand back what you computed:

```soli
order = Order.transaction do
  account = Account.find(account_id)   # `find` (key lookup) sees in-transaction state
  account.balance -= amount
  account.save()
  Order.create({ "account_id": account_id, "total": amount })["record"]
end
```

Nested `transaction` calls **join** the outer transaction — only the outermost
begins and commits/rolls back (SolidB has no savepoints), so a `throw` anywhere
inside undoes every write in the whole nest.

> **Query-builder reads inside a transaction are not transactional.** Document
> operations — `create`, `save`, `update`, `delete`, and key lookups via `find`
> — run through the transaction and see its uncommitted writes. Query-builder
> reads (`where`, `all`, `first`, `count`, `find_by`, `first_by`) do not: they
> go to the ordinary query endpoint and read the state as it was before the
> block began.
>
> That matters for read-modify-write:
>
> ```soli
> Account.transaction do
>   Account.create({ "owner": owner_id, "balance": 0 })
>   # Reads the pre-transaction state — the row above is not counted yet.
>   existing = Account.where({ "owner": owner_id }).count
> end
> ```
>
> Uniqueness validations run this kind of read, so two records that violate a
> uniqueness rule can both pass validation inside one block and both commit.
> Where it matters, do the check with `find` / `find_by` on the key, or enforce
> it with a unique index rather than a validation.


> **Cursor reads see committed state.** Queries inside the block
> (`.where(...).all()`, `find_by`, aggregations) read *committed* data — they do
> not observe the transaction's own uncommitted writes. To read a row you wrote
> earlier in the same transaction, use `find` (a key lookup).

### Using AQL String

```soli
# Execute a single AQL statement transactionally (auto-commits).
# The string runs through the cursor endpoint with bind variables, so the
# query parameter is never interpolated into server-side JavaScript.
result = User.transaction("
  FOR u IN users FILTER u.active == true UPDATE u WITH { last_seen: DATE_NOW() } IN users
")
```

### Using Transaction Object (Manual Control)

```soli
# Get transaction handle for manual control
tx = User.transaction();
tx.create({ name: "Alice" });
tx.create({ name: "Bob" });
tx.commit();
# Or tx.rollback() to undo all changes
```

All operations within the transaction either all succeed or all fail together.

class User < Model
    def posts()
        Post.where("doc.author_id == @id", { "id": this.id })
    end
end
```

## Custom Methods

Add custom methods to your models:

```soli
class User < Model
  def is_admin() -> Bool
    this.role == "admin"
  end

  def full_name() -> String
    this.first_name + " " + this.last_name
  end
end

# Usage
user = User.find("user123");
if user.is_admin()
  print("Welcome, admin " + user.full_name());
end
```

## Query Generation (SDBQL)

Under the hood, Model methods generate SDBQL (SoliDB Query Language) queries:

| Method | Generated SDBQL |
|--------|-----------------|
| `User.all` | `FOR doc IN users RETURN doc` |
| `User.where("age >= @age", {"age": 18})` | `FOR doc IN users FILTER doc.age >= @age RETURN doc` |
| `.order("name", "asc")` | `... SORT doc.name ASC RETURN doc` |
| `.limit(10).offset(20)` | `... LIMIT 20, 10 RETURN doc` |
| `User.count` | `RETURN COLLECTION_COUNT("users")` |
| `User.includes("posts")` | `FOR doc IN users LET _rel_posts = (FOR rel IN posts FILTER rel.user_id == doc._key RETURN rel) RETURN MERGE(doc, {posts: _rel_posts})` |
| `User.includes("posts", "published = @p", {"p": true})` | `... FILTER rel.user_id == doc._key AND rel.published == @p RETURN rel ...` |
| `User.includes({"posts": ["title"]})` | `... RETURN {title: rel.title} ...` |
| `User.select("name", "email")` | `FOR doc IN users RETURN {name: doc.name, email: doc.email, _key: doc._key}` |
| `User.join("posts")` | `FOR doc IN users FILTER LENGTH(FOR rel IN posts FILTER rel.user_id == doc._key LIMIT 1 RETURN 1) > 0 RETURN doc` |

SDBQL uses:
- `FOR doc IN collection` instead of `SELECT * FROM`
- `FILTER expression` instead of `WHERE`
- `SORT doc.field ASC/DESC` instead of `ORDER BY`
- `@variable` syntax for bind parameters
- `LET` subqueries + `MERGE` for eager loading

## Complete Example

```soli
# app/models/user.sl
class User < Model
  has_many("posts")      # strings and symbols both work
  has_many(:posts)       # Ruby-style symbol shorthand
  has_one("profile")

  validates("email", { "presence": true, "uniqueness": true })
  validates("name", { "presence": true, "min_length": 2 })

  before_save("normalize_email")   # strings and symbols both work
  before_save(:normalize_email)    # Ruby-style symbol shorthand

  def normalize_email()
    this.email = this.email.downcase;
  end

  def is_adult() -> Bool
    this.age >= 18
  end
end

# app/models/post.sl
class Post < Model
  belongs_to("user")     # symbols also work
  has_many("comments")

  validates("title", { "presence": true, "min_length": 3 })
end

# app/models/profile.sl
class Profile < Model
  belongs_to("user")
end

# Usage in controller
class UsersController < Controller
  def index
    # Eager load posts and profiles to avoid N+1 queries
    @users = User.includes("posts", "profile").all
  end

  def show
    @user = User.includes("posts").find(params["id"])
  end

  def active
    # Find active users who have at least one post
    @users = User.join("posts")
      .where("active = @a", { "a": true })
      .order("created_at", "desc")
      .limit(10)
      .all
  end

  def create
    @user = User.create(permit(params, { "name": true, "email": true, "age": true }))
    return render("users/new", {}, { "status": 422 }) if @user._errors

    redirect("/users/" + @user._key)
  end
end
```

## Testing Models

See the [Testing Guide](/docs/testing) for comprehensive information on testing models.

### Mock Database Queries

For integration tests without a real database, use `Model.mock_query_result()`:

```soli
describe("User queries", fn()
  before_each(fn()
    User.clear_mocks()
  end)
  
  after_each(fn()
    User.clear_mocks()
  end)
  
  test("finds user by id", fn()
    User.mock_query_result(
      "FOR doc IN users FILTER doc._key == @key RETURN doc",
      [
        {
          "_key": "123",
          "_id": "default:users/123",
          "name": "Alice",
          "email": "alice@example.com"
        }
      ]
    )
    
    user = User.find("123")
    expect(user.name).to_equal("Alice")
  end)
  
  test("includes returns correct class for relations", fn()
    # Mock the parent query
    Contact.mock_query_result(
      "FOR doc IN contacts RETURN doc",
      [
        {
          "_key": "c1",
          "_id": "default:contacts/c1",
          "name": "Bob",
          "organisation_id": "default:organisations/o1"
        }
      ]
    )
    
    # Mock the included relation query
    Organisation.mock_query_result(
      "FOR doc IN organisations FILTER doc._key IN @keys RETURN doc",
      [
        {
          "_key": "o1",
          "_id": "default:organisations/o1",
          "name": "Acme Corp"
        }
      ]
    )
    
    contact = Contact.includes("organisation").first
    org = contact.organisation
    
    # Verify the relation has the correct class (not Contact)
    expect(org.class_name).to_equal("Organisation")
    expect(org.name).to_equal("Acme Corp")
  end)
end)
```

Key points:
- `Model.mock_query_result(query, results)` - Register mock data for an AQL query
- `Model.clear_mocks()` - Remove all registered mocks
- Include relations require mocking both the parent and related queries
- The `_id` field (e.g., `"default:organisations/o1"`) determines the correct class for included documents

```soli
describe("User model", fn()
  test("creates user with valid data", fn()
    user = User.create({
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "name": "Test User"
    });
    expect(user._errors).to_equal(null);
    expect(user.email).to_equal("test@example.com");
  end)

  test("fails validation for invalid data", fn()
    user = User.create({ "email": "" });
    expect(user._errors).not_to_equal(null);
  end)

  test("finds users with where clause", fn()
    User.create({ "name": "Alice", "age": 25 });
    User.create({ "name": "Bob", "age": 17 });

    # where() returns QueryBuilder - chain .all to get results
    adults = User.where("doc.age >= @age", { "age": 18 }).all;
    expect(len(adults)).to_equal(1);
  end)
end)
```

## Inspecting Queries (Dev Tool)

When the server runs with `--dev`, every query a request executes through the Model layer is captured into a per-request stack. Read it with the `dev_queries()` builtin and render it however you like — typically as a debug bar at the bottom of the page.

**This covers every backend.** On SoliDB the entries are AQL; on the SQL adapters
they are the SQL actually sent, with the bind values numbered as `$1` / `?`
appear in the statement. That means the dev bar's DB panel and timings, the
N+1 badge, `assert_no_n_plus_one`, and `soli test --fail-on-n1` work the same on
Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite. Bind values longer than 200 characters are truncated
(with their real length noted) so a large document cannot flood the panel.

### `dev_queries()`

Returns an `Array<Hash>` of queries executed during the **current request**. The stack is cleared at the start of every request.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `query` | `String` | The statement sent to the database (AQL on SoliDB, SQL on the SQL adapters) |
| `bind_vars` | `Hash` or `null` | The bind variables, or `null` if the query had none |
| `duration_ms` | `Float` | Wall-clock time the query took, in milliseconds |

In production (without `--dev`), `dev_queries()` always returns an empty array — the executor skips logging entirely, so there's no overhead.

### Example: Controller

```soli
def index
  users = User.where("doc.active == true").all;
  posts = Post.includes("author").all;

  return render("users/index", {
    "users":   users,
    "posts":   posts,
    "queries": dev_queries()
  });
end
```

### Example: Debug bar partial

```erb
<%# app/views/shared/_dev_bar.erb %>
<% if queries.length > 0 %>
  <div class="dev-bar">
    <h3><%= queries.length %> AQL queries</h3>
    <ol>
      <% for q in queries %>
        <li>
          <code><%= q["query"] %></code>
          <% if q["bind_vars"] != null %>
            <small>binds: <%= json_stringify(q["bind_vars"]) %></small>
          <% end %>
          <span><%= q["duration_ms"] %> ms</span>
        </li>
      <% end %>
    </ol>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

### Coverage

Logged:
- All `Model` operations (`Model.all`, `.where()`, `.find()`, `.create()`, `.update()`, `.destroy()`, `.count`, eager-loaded `includes`, soft-delete scopes, etc.)
- Validation lookups (`uniqueness`)
- HABTM join-table operations

Not logged in v1:
- Direct `Solidb(host, db).query(...)` calls
- Mocked queries registered via `register_query_mock` (they short-circuit before the executor)
- Internal session storage queries that go through `SoliDBClient` directly

## Best Practices

1. **Keep models simple** - Just extend `Model`, no configuration needed
2. **Use meaningful class names** - They become collection names automatically
3. **Add validations** - Validate data before it reaches the database
4. **Use callbacks wisely** - Keep them focused and avoid heavy operations
5. **Add custom methods** - Encapsulate business logic in model methods
6. **Declare relationships** - Use `has_many`, `has_one`, `belongs_to` for associations
7. **Use `includes` for eager loading** - Avoid N+1 queries when accessing related data
8. **Use `join` for filtering** - When you only need to filter by existence, not preload
9. **Use migrations in production** - Define indexes and schema for optimal performance

## Database Migrations

> **Note**: Collections are now automatically created when you first use a Model. You can start using your models immediately without creating migrations.

However, for production applications, we recommend using migrations to:
- Define indexes for better query performance
- Set collection options (e.g., key options, sharding)
- Document your schema
- Handle schema changes over time

See the [Migrations Guide](/docs/migrations) for creating collections and indexes.
