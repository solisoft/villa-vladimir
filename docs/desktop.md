# Desktop Applications

`soli desktop build` packages an app as a single executable that carries its own
database. The user double-clicks it; it starts a private database, opens their
browser, and serves the app locally. No installer, no separate database, no
configuration.

```bash
soli desktop build ./myapp --app-id com.example.myapp
```

That produces one file. Run it and the app opens.

## Deep links into a desktop artifact

Launch with a path or custom-scheme URL so the first screen after the launch
token is not always `/`:

```bash
./myapp --open /pings/3
./myapp myapp://host/pings/3
SOLI_DESKTOP_OPEN=/dashboard ./myapp
```

After the one-shot session exchange, the browser is redirected to that path.

`soli desktop build` writes helpers next to the artifact:

- `register-protocol.sh` + `<scheme>.desktop` (Linux)
- `register-protocol.ps1` (Windows)
- `DEEP_LINKS.txt`

```bash
./register-protocol.sh          # Linux
.\register-protocol.ps1         # Windows
# or re-emit helpers for any binary:
soli desktop register-protocol --exe ./myapp --scheme myapp --name "My App"
```

macOS custom schemes are cleaner in a native shell (`CFBundleURLTypes`).  
Generated Linux/Windows **mobile-style** clients under `soli generate client`
also ship registration helpers.

In-app `Updater.check()` / `Updater.apply()` work on desktop builds that were
packaged with `--update-url` / `--update-key` (the outer payload descriptor is
stashed at boot).

## A native window instead of a browser

With a soli built with `--features eui-desktop`, an app that has EUI
components (see [EUI](/docs/eui/overview)) can be packaged to open one
of them in its own window — no browser, no HTML:

```bash
soli desktop build ./myapp --app-id com.example.myapp --eui dashboard
```

`dashboard` is a component name given to `router_eui`. The artifact still
carries the runtime, the encrypted app and its database; at launch the server
runs on a thread and the embedded EUI client draws the component on the GPU
in a window titled after the app. The loopback gate is armed with a session
only that client holds, presented as a cookie on every request, so no other
local process can reach the app. The EUI publisher key is generated per
install in the app's state directory — a bundle never carries the developer's
`config/eui_publisher.pkcs8`, whatever the build. Capabilities the manifest
asks for are granted: the person installed the app.

`--eui` cannot be combined with `--target` yet, because a runtime for another
target is fetched prebuilt without the window. `SOLI_DESKTOP_NO_WINDOW=1`
prints the session URL and cookie and serves without opening anything.

## What the artifact contains

```
[ soli runtime ]
[ manifest        — app identity, versions, checksums ]
[ app.sole        — your application, encrypted ]
[ solidb          — the database binary, compressed ]
[ ref_*.ndjson    — read-only reference data (optional) ]
```

Your application source is **always encrypted**. There is no unencrypted desktop
build, because that would ship your source in the clear to every user.

## Requirements

The application must be unlockable at launch, which means a key. Set either
`SOLI_BUNDLE_KEY` (the key itself) or `SOLI_BUNDLE_AUTH_URL` (a key server that
returns it) at both build time and run time — the same resolution chain
`soli build --encrypt` uses. See [Deployment](/docs/development-tools/deploy).

**There is no offline fallback.** The key is never written to disk, so an app
that cannot reach its key server does not start. That is the trade for being
able to revoke an installation.

## Options

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--app-id <id>` | Reverse-DNS identity, e.g. `com.example.myapp`. **Required.** Determines where the user's data lives, so changing it between releases orphans their existing data. |
| `--name <name>` | Display name. Defaults to the source directory's name. |
| `--output <path>` | Artifact path. Defaults to `<app>` or `<app>-<target>`. |
| `--target <t>` | Cross-build: `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`, `windows-amd64`. |
| `--solidb <path>` | Embed a locally built database binary instead of downloading the published release. |
| `--solidb-version <v>` | Database release to download. Pinned by default. |
| `--no-db` | Embed and start no database: for an app whose state lives in memory or behind an API. The artifact loses the 18 MB database binary and the launch loses its database process. |
| `--db-url <url>` | Embed no database; at launch the app's model layer and session store point at this `solidb` address. Credentials come from the app's `.env` or the environment, as they do under `soli serve`. |
| `--seed <dir>` | Directory of `<collection>.ndjson` reference data. |
| `--protect` | Compile the app to a binary AST, stripping source and comments. |

## Shipping reference data

Read-only data your app needs — a country list, a price table — can travel with
the artifact:

```bash
soli desktop build ./myapp --app-id com.example.myapp --seed ./seed
```

Each `seed/<name>.ndjson` is one JSON document per line. It is imported at first
launch, and re-imported only when the content changes.

**Seed collections must be named `ref_*`.** The build fails otherwise, and the
reason matters: importing **replaces a collection wholesale**. Without the
prefix, shipping a `users.ndjson` would silently destroy the user's own `users`
data on their next launch. The prefix keeps the two namespaces disjoint by
construction rather than by review.

```
seed/
  ref_countries.ndjson     ✓
  ref_currencies.ndjson    ✓
  users.ndjson             ✗ build fails — could collide with your model
```

## Where user data lives

| | Data (persists) | Cache (safe to delete) |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/<app-id>/db` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/<app-id>/bin` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/<app-id>/db` | `~/Library/Caches/<app-id>/bin` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<app-id>\db` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<app-id>\cache\bin` |

The database binary is cached and reused across launches, re-verified against
its checksum each time. Deleting the cache costs one extraction, not data.

A second launch of the same app is refused while the first is running — two
servers over one database directory would fail deep inside the storage engine
with an unhelpful error.

## Protecting data at rest

The database files sit in the user's own directory. Mark sensitive fields so
they are encrypted with the key fetched at launch:

```soli
class Customer < Model
  encrypts :tax_id, :bank_account
end
```

Encrypted fields **cannot be queried by value** — each write uses a fresh nonce,
so the ciphertext differs every time. Encrypt what must stay confidential, not
what you filter on.

Fields you do not mark are stored in plaintext and `strings` will find them.

## What this protects against, and what it does not

Worth being precise, because "encrypted desktop app" promises more than any
local software can deliver.

**It does protect against:** a copied artifact being useful to someone without
an authorized key; casual inspection of your source; other local processes
driving the app's API or its database; and it lets you revoke an installation.

**It does not protect against the machine's owner.** The key reaches the process
environment at launch, and on their own machine a user can read it — from
`/proc/<pid>/environ`, from a debugger, from process memory. Assume a motivated
user recovers it. Once they have, it decrypts that data offline, forever.

Treat this as **licensing-grade protection**: it stops copying and enables
revocation. It is not confidentiality against your user. If you hold data whose
disclosure to that user would be a breach, keep it on your server behind an
authenticated API and cache only derived, non-sensitive results locally.

## The local port

The app binds `127.0.0.1` on a port the OS assigns, so it never appears on the
network and never collides with another app.

Loopback keeps the network out but not the machine — every process running as
that user can reach the port. So the browser is launched with a single-use token
that it exchanges once for a session cookie; everything else gets `403`. The
token expires in 60 seconds and a wrong guess burns it.

One limitation to know: cookies are not port-scoped, so another local server in
the same browser profile could read the session cookie. Closing that needs
loopback HTTPS with a per-launch certificate, which means touching the user's
trust store. What the gate does close is a non-browser local process driving
your API.

## Embedding in a native shell

The artifact opens the app in a chrome-less browser window. If you wrap it in a
native shell of your own — a Cocoa/WebView app, an Electron-style container —
you want your window, not that one. Set `SOLI_DESKTOP_NO_WINDOW=1` and the
server opens nothing:

```bash
SOLI_DESKTOP_NO_WINDOW=1 ./myapp
```

The launch URL is still printed, on its own indented line, and your shell needs
it: it carries the single-use token described above, so pointing a web view at
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` directly gets a `403`. Read the child's stdout, take
the first `http://127.0.0.1:` line, and load that.

Send `SIGTERM` when your window closes so the database and the decrypted tree
are cleaned up in order — see [Stopping](#stopping).

Once your shell owns the window it can also own notifications: see
[Native Bridge](/docs/development-tools/native-bridge), which lets server-side
Soli raise a real OS notification in your shell. A web view has no Push API and
no Notification API, so that bridge is the only way an embedded app gets one.

## Cross-building

`--target` downloads a published runtime and database for that platform and
verifies both against their checksums. It does not compile anything, so you can
build every target from one machine:

```bash
soli desktop build ./myapp --app-id com.example.myapp --target darwin-arm64
soli desktop build ./myapp --app-id com.example.myapp --target windows-amd64
```

Two signing notes, both of which bite at distribution rather than build time:

- **macOS** artifacts built elsewhere have an invalid signature and Apple
  Silicon refuses to run them. Re-sign on a Mac with `codesign --force -s -`, or
  use `rcodesign` from any platform.
- **Windows** artifacts are unsigned, so SmartScreen shows "Windows protected
  your PC" with *Run anyway* hidden behind *More info*. Sign the **finished**
  file — never before packaging, which would invalidate the signature:
  `signtool sign /fd sha256 /tr <timestamp-url> /td sha256 myapp.exe`.

## Stopping

Closing the terminal, or `SIGTERM`, shuts the app down in order: the decrypted
application tree is removed first, then the database is closed cleanly. A clean
close matters — an abrupt kill makes the storage engine replay its write-ahead
log on the next launch, which is slow and looks like corruption.

A hard `kill -9` skips this; the leftover directory is swept at the next launch.

## Size

A typical artifact is 70–80 MB, mostly the database binary (stored compressed,
roughly a third of its size). It contains everything: runtime, application,
database and reference data.

Measured on 2026-09-07 for the EUI `counter-app` example, x86-64 Linux,
and the last row on 2026-09-08:

| | runtime | artifact |
|---|---:|---:|
| `soli` as installed (no EUI) | 66 MB | — |
| `--features eui-desktop`, default features | 78 MB | 96 MB |
| `--no-default-features --features eui-desktop` (2026-09-07) | 61 MB | 80 MB |
| `--features eui-desktop`, default features, `--no-db` | 78 MB | 76 MB |
| `--no-default-features --features eui-desktop` (2026-09-08) | **46 MB** | **52.6 MB** (`--no-db`) |

A desktop artifact starts two server workers, not one per core: each
worker is an interpreter with every handler warmed, and one person at one
window needs no more (measured on the feed example: 117 MB of runtime at
rest with eight workers, 68 MB with two). `--workers N` or `SOLI_WORKERS`
override it.

The EUI window costs 12 MB. `--no-db` removes the database binary (about
20 MB of artifact) and the database process at launch; `--db-url` does the
same for an app whose database is elsewhere.

The runtime built for an offline application is the last row, and what it
drops is now six named features — `ssh`, `office`, `pdf`, `cloud`, `mail`,
`lsp` — on top of the database clients and the code-graph grammars
([Configuration → Slim binary](configuration.md#slim-binary-cargo-features)).
That took the runtime from 61 MB to 46. Dropping a browser still does not
make the artifact small: what remains is the interpreter itself (10 MB of
machine code before any dependency), the HTTP stack its own server runs
on, and the window — wgpu, its shader translator, text shaping, the
accessibility bridge. The EUI project's ~15 MB target is not reachable by
subtraction from here, and the numbers above are what it costs today.

## Staying current

A desktop artifact is a frozen binary — to ship a fix you'd otherwise ask every
user to re-download it by hand. Build it with `--update-url` and it can check a
release channel you control and replace itself with a newer, cryptographically
signed build:

```bash
soli desktop build ./my_app --app-id com.example.myapp \
  --update-url https://updates.example.com/my_app \
  --update-key <p256-pubkey>
```

The running app then supports `--check-update` / `--update`, or drives the flow
from Soli via `Updater.check()` / `Updater.apply()`. See
[Auto-Update (OTA)](/docs/development-tools/auto-update) for signing keys,
publishing a manifest, and the security model.
