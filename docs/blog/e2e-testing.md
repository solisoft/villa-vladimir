# Full End-to-End Tests in Pure Soli (No Playwright, No Node)

Most teams today write their application in one language and their integration tests in another.

You have a beautiful Soli backend… and then you reach for Playwright, Cypress, or a pile of `fetch` calls in a separate test runner just to verify that your controllers actually return the right HTML and that sessions work.

Soli takes a different stance: the best way to test a Soli application is with Soli.

The E2E testing framework gives you a real HTTP server that starts and stops automatically, a clean BDD DSL, powerful request/response helpers, session inspection, and coverage reporting — all without leaving the language or adding a single Node dependency.

## The Test Server

When you run `soli test`, any E2E spec files automatically bring up an isolated test server on a random port. Each test file gets a clean instance. No port conflicts, no manual server management, no state leaking between runs.

```soli
describe("Checkout Flow", fn()
    before_each(fn()
        # Fresh data for every test
        @user = create_test_user()
    end)

    test("completes a successful purchase", fn()
        response = post("/checkout", {
            "product_id": @product.id,
            "quantity": 2
        })

        assert_eq(res_status(response), 302)
        assert(res_location(response).includes?("/orders/"))

        # Verify side effects
        order = Order.last
        assert_eq(order.user_id, @user.id)
        assert_eq(order.total, 199.00)
    end)
end)
```

## Request & Response Helpers

The framework provides ergonomic helpers that feel natural in Soli:

- `get(path)`
- `post(path, body)`
- `put(path, body)`
- `delete(path)`

Response inspection is equally pleasant:

```soli
response = get("/products/" + product.id)
assert_eq(res_status(response), 200)

html = res_body(response)
assert(html.includes?("Add to cart"))

json = res_json(response)          # automatic JSON parsing
assert_eq(json["name"], "Wireless Headphones")
```

You also get:

- `res_headers(response)`
- `res_location(response)` for redirect targets

## Real Session Testing

Because requests go through the real session middleware, you can test authenticated flows properly. Three helpers cover the common cases:

- `as_user(user_id)` — simulate a logged-in user for the next request.
- `create_session(user_id)` — issue a real session cookie reused across requests.
- `with_session({...})` — seed arbitrary server-side session data (test-only).

```soli
test("requires login to view orders", fn()
    response = get("/orders")
    assert_eq(res_status(response), 302)
    assert(res_location(response).includes?("/login"))
end)

test("logged in user sees their orders", fn()
    as_user(@user.id)

    response = get("/orders")
    assert_eq(res_status(response), 200)
    assert(res_body(response).includes?("Order #1234"))
end)
```

## Coverage That Actually Matters

Running with `--coverage` instruments your application code (controllers, models, etc.) and reports real line coverage from the E2E tests. The project template even enforces a minimum via `--coverage-min 90`.

This is integration coverage — the kind that actually protects you — not just unit test theater.

## Why This Approach Wins

- **Zero context switching** — You stay in Soli the entire time.
- **Fast feedback** — No slow browser automation unless you truly need it.
- **Reliable** — Same runtime, same ORM, same everything as production.
- **Low maintenance** — No separate test infrastructure to keep green.

For the majority of controller and flow testing, this is dramatically more effective than driving a real browser for every scenario.

And when you *do* need a real browser — complex JavaScript, a form as the user actually submits it — you still don't leave Soli. `soli test --browser` drives a real headless Chrome over the DevTools protocol, straight from the `soli` binary:

```soli
test("the coupon applies without a reload", fn() {
  visit("/cart")
  fill_in("Coupon", "SAVE10")
  click_button("Apply")

  assert_text("Discount applied")
  assert_no_page_errors()
})
```

No Node, no npm, no Playwright, no 300MB browser download in CI — just a Chrome on the machine. Browser specs are opt-in (they cost seconds, not milliseconds), and they share the cookie jar with the HTTP helpers, so the `login()` above carries straight into `visit()`.

So the tiering still holds, and now both tiers are the same language: fast HTTP specs for the bulk of it, real browser specs for the handful of flows that genuinely need a DOM. See [Browser Testing](/docs/testing-browser) for the full set of helpers.

If your current testing story involves two languages and a slow CI stage just to hit your own controllers, Soli’s approach is worth experiencing. The difference in speed and joy is substantial.
