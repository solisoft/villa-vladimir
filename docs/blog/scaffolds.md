# Scaffolds That Don’t Suck: One Command from Zero to Production-Ready Code

Most framework scaffolds are a joke.

You run `rails generate scaffold` or the Laravel equivalent and you get a pile of generated files that immediately violate your team’s conventions, miss proper authorization, contain placeholder validations, and require two hours of cleanup before they’re even worth committing.

Soli’s generator story is different by design.

## The Full Resource Command

The most powerful experience is the custom slash command available to AI agents and humans alike:

```
/soli-resource post
```

This single command performs (and pauses at the right moment):

1. `soli generate scaffold post` (optionally with field args) — model, controller, views, migration, routes, and `tests/controllers/post_controller_spec.sl`
2. `soli db:migrate up`
3. Extends or renames the controller spec if your project uses a flatter `tests/*_spec.sl` layout
4. Adds a model unit spec by hand if you want one (scaffold does not emit a model test)

It then **intentionally pauses** and tells you:

> Edit the model to add fields, validations, and associations, then continue.

This is the exact moment where human judgment is most valuable. Everything after that point can be generated safely and consistently.

## What You Actually Get

When the process finishes you have:

- A model with sensible default validations
- A controller that follows the exact conventions (thin, proper error handling)
- Named route helpers already wired up
- Views that use the standard layout and partial patterns
- A migration that is ready to run
- A spec file that already exercises the basic CRUD actions

No "TODO" comments. No broken imports. No "we’ll fix the tests later."

## Why This Matters for Humans *and* Agents

For humans, it removes the soul-crushing boilerplate tax of starting a new resource.

For AI agents, it is transformative. The `/soli-resource` command is one of the highest-leverage tools in the AI scaffolding system. An agent can reliably deliver a full, working, tested resource with minimal supervision because the generator already did the hard part of getting the shape right.

## Consistency at Scale

Because the generators are the source of truth for "how we structure a resource," every new feature starts from the same high-quality baseline. Over time this compounds into a codebase that feels remarkably uniform even when many different people (and agents) have touched it.

The next time you need to add a new domain concept, try reaching for the generator first instead of writing everything by hand. You might be surprised how little you actually need to customize afterward.

Scaffolding is one of those areas where "the framework should just do the boring parts correctly." In Soli, it actually does.
