# Metaprogramming

Soli supports runtime introspection and code generation: `respond_to?`, `send`, `method_missing`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, `define_method`, `alias_method`, `inherited`, plus instance variable inspection helpers.

This page focuses on two capabilities that let you extend the language from pure Soli code: **adding methods to primitive types** and **defining custom Model DSL helpers**.

## Class reopening with `define_method` and `alias_method`

You can add methods to any class after it's defined. This works on user-defined classes:

```soli
class Greeter
  def say
    "hello"
  end
end

Greeter.define_method("shout", fn() { "HELLO!" })
Greeter.alias_method("yell", "shout")

let g = Greeter.new
g.shout    # => "HELLO!"
g.yell     # => "HELLO!"
```

`class_eval` runs a block with `self` and `this` bound to the class. Inside, `define_method` writes to that class:

```soli
Greeter.class_eval do
  define_method("wave", fn() { "👋" })
end
```

## Extending primitive types

The same machinery works on built-in primitive types: `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Decimal`, `String`, `Array`, `Hash`, `Symbol`, `Null`. User-defined methods are stored in a per-type overlay and are checked **before** built-in methods, so you can add new methods or shadow existing ones.

```soli
Int.define_method("doubled", fn() { this * 2 })
Int.define_method("times_n", fn(n) { this * n })

3.doubled        # => 6   (zero-arg auto-invokes without parens)
3.doubled()      # => 6
4.times_n(5)     # => 20

String.define_method("shout", fn() { this + "!!!" })
"hi".shout()     # => "hi!!!"

Array.define_method("second", fn() { this[1] })
[10, 20, 30].second()   # => 20
```

`alias_method` works intra-type:

```soli
String.define_method("yell", fn() { this + "!" })
String.alias_method("shout", "yell")
"ok".shout    # => "ok!"
```

### Precedence

Lookup order on a primitive value:

1. User-defined methods (registered via `define_method` / `class_eval`).
2. Built-in methods (`length`, `upcase`, `map`, `times`, etc.).
3. For `Hash`: literal hash-key fallback (`h.foo` returns the value at key `"foo"`).

So a user method on `Hash` will shadow the literal-key fallback. This matches Ruby's monkey-patching semantics.

### Performance

Dispatch is gated by a single Relaxed atomic load. When no user methods have been registered for any primitive type, every call to `3.foo` short-circuits in one cycle and falls straight through to the built-in match. Registered methods cost a single hashmap lookup on the slow path.

### Threading and worker model

The user-method overlay is `thread_local!` — each worker thread (in `soli serve`) has its own copy. Registration that happens during model/controller load runs once per worker, so the overlays are consistent across workers without needing a global lock.

## Named scopes

`scope` is a class-body DSL — same shape as `validates`, `has_many`, `before_save`. The class is auto-prepended to the call, and `this` inside the closure is bound to a fresh `QueryBuilder` for the model:

```soli
class Post < Model
  scope("published", fn() { this.where("status = @s", { "s": "published" }) })
  scope("recent",    fn() { this.order("created_at", "desc").limit(10) })
end

# Accessing the scope name invokes the closure and returns a QueryBuilder:
let posts = Post.published.where("author_id = @id", { "id": 42 }).all
```

The closure returns the (possibly refined) `QueryBuilder`. Scopes compose with the rest of the query DSL — `Post.published.recent` chains them.

Scope storage is per-thread (`Rc<Function>` is `!Send` and can't go in the process-global `MODEL_REGISTRY`); each worker registers scopes when it loads its model files.

## Instance `method_missing`

When an instance receives a message it has no method for, `method_missing(name, ...)` runs with the method name first. Parameters the call did not supply are `nil`. A **last parameter named `args`** receives every remaining argument as an array, so a catch-all takes any arity:

```soli
class Recorder
  def method_missing(name, args)
    "#{name} called with #{args.length} argument(s)"
  end
end

recorder = new Recorder()
recorder.anything(1, 2, 3)   # "anything called with 3 argument(s)"
```

A bare `obj.name` (no parentheses) evaluates to the bound method, not its result; call with `()`.

## Fields by name

`record[name]` reads a field whose name is only known at run time, and
`record[name] = value` writes it — the same read and write as `record.name`,
on any instance, models included:

```soli
def copy_fields(source, target, names)
  names.each do |name|
    target[name] = source[name]
  end
end

copy_fields(draft, post, ["title", "body"])
```

The write follows the rules of `record.name = value`: a `private` or
`protected` field is refused from outside the class (`this[name]` inside it is
fine), a `const` field cannot be reassigned, a model's `_`-prefixed metadata
(`_key`, `_id`, …) is read-only, and a translated field is staged for the next
save. A missing field reads as `nil`. Both engines agree, and the type checker
accepts a String index on any instance.
