# Formatting (`soli fmt`)

`soli fmt` rewrites `.sl` source files into Soli's canonical style. It parses
the file, then re-emits the AST with normalized indent, spacing, and keywords —
so the output is guaranteed to be syntactically identical to the input, just
re-formatted.

## Usage

```bash
soli fmt                          # Format every .sl file under the cwd, in place
soli fmt path/to/file.sl          # Format a single file
soli fmt app/ lib/                # Format every .sl file under one or more paths
soli fmt --check                  # Don't rewrite — exit non-zero if any file would change
soli fmt --stdin < in.sl > out.sl # Filter mode for editor integration
```

A few details worth knowing:

- With no path argument, the current working directory is walked recursively.
- Without `--check`, every changed file is written back in place. Already-formatted
  files are left untouched (no spurious mtime bump).
- `--check` prints `would reformat: <path>` for each file that would change and
  exits with status `1` if any file is unformatted. Use this in CI to enforce
  style.
- `--stdin` reads from stdin and writes to stdout — no file is touched. This is
  the mode editor integrations should use to run a "format on save" or
  "format selection" command.

## Style

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Indent | 2 spaces, never tabs |
| Functions | `def name() ... end` (parens kept even when empty) |
| Classes | `class X < Y ... end` |
| Control flow | `if cond ... end`, `while cond ... end`, etc. |
| Operators | Normalized spacing — `a + b`, `a == b`, `a && b` |
| Comments | Preserved at their original line positions |
| Comment marker | `//` line comments are normalized to `#` |
| Blank lines | Multiple consecutive blank lines collapse to one |
| Guard clauses | `if cond return … end` with no `else` gets a trailing blank line |
| Early returns | A `return` is followed by a blank line, unless the next statement is another `return` or the block's `end` follows |
| Raw strings | `""" … """` and `r"…"` are copied from source verbatim — never re-escaped |
| Escapes | A `"…"` literal written with `\u`, `\e` or `\0` is kept as written; elsewhere, control and invisible characters (NBSP, zero-width, bidi) are written as `\e`, `\0` or `\u{…}`, never as raw bytes |
| `begin`/`rescue` | Canonicalized to the `try`/`catch` synonym |

An early return gets breathing room from the body below it, while a run of
guards stays grouped as one paragraph:

```soli
def publish(post)
  return error("missing") if post.nil?
  return error("draft") unless post.published?

  post.notify_subscribers()
  redirect("/posts/#{post._key}")
end
```

A raw literal keeps the form you wrote it in. Re-escaping one is
semantics-preserving but defeats its purpose — a multi-line `""" … """` SDBQL
query would collapse into a single line of `\n` escapes long enough to trip
`style/line-length`:

```soli
db.query("""
  FOR post IN posts
    FILTER post.published == true
    RETURN post
""")
```

### Migrating `[[ … ]]` strings

`[[ … ]]` was a raw string until it was removed; `[[` is a nested array now.
`soli fmt --migrate-raw-strings [paths]` rewrites the old strings as
`""" … """` (applying the old rule: a `[[` outside strings and comments, not
followed by a digit, `-` or `[`), then formats. Run it **once**, on code
written before the change — on newer code it would read `[["a", 1]]` as a
string. A string whose content holds `"""` is reported and left for you.

The formatter never changes program semantics. If you spot output that breaks
your code, that's a bug — please report it.

## Generated code is already formatted

`soli new` and every `soli generate` run their `.sl` output through the
formatter, so a freshly generated app passes `soli fmt --check` from its first
commit and your first `fmt` run produces no diff of files you never touched.

## Editor integration

Hook `soli fmt --stdin` into your editor's "format document" command. The
filter mode is the same shape as `gofmt`, `rustfmt --emit=stdout`, or
`black -`, so most LSP/format-tool wrappers can drive it with no extra config.

For LSPs that prefer a project command, point at:

```bash
soli fmt --stdin
```

See [Editor Integration](/docs/development-tools/editor-integration) for
language-server setup.

## CI usage

The recommended CI check:

```bash
soli fmt --check
```

This exits non-zero on the first unformatted file it sees, listing each one as
`would reformat: <path>`. Pair it with `soli lint` for a complete style gate.

## Coverage and the fallback

Soli's grammar has a handful of advanced forms the formatter does not yet
canonicalize: `@sdbql{ … }` query blocks, list/hash comprehensions, and some
complex match patterns. For these nodes the formatter copies the original
source bytes verbatim via the AST span — semantics are preserved, and the
surrounding code is still formatted, but the body of the un-modeled node is
left untouched.

You can mix formatted and un-modeled code freely; running `soli fmt` repeatedly
is safe (the output is a fixed point).
